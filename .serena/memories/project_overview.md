# Kitchen Bar Project Overview

## Purpose
Home improvement design project for a split-level kitchen bar. The goal is to replace an existing metal railing between the kitchen and living room with a bar that includes cabinet storage.

## Key Constraints
- Kitchen is 23.5" higher than living room (fixed step height)
- Seating on kitchen side (facing living room)
- Butcher block countertop
- Continuous cabinet from bar top to living room floor
- ~84" (7 ft) bar length, 28" depth

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React 19 with Vite 7
- **Language**: JavaScript/JSX (no TypeScript)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Purpose**: 2D/3D visualization of bar design concepts

## Project Type
This is a design visualization tool, not a production web app. The focus is on:

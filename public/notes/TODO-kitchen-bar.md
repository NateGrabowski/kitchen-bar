# Kitchen Bar Project TODO

**Created:** 2026-01-08
**Status:** Planning → Build

---

## Phase 1: Final Design Decisions
*Finish these BEFORE buying materials*

### Cabinet Design

- [x] **Decide on cabinet approach** ✓ CUSTOM BUILD
  - ~~IKEA SEKTION hybrid~~ — OUT (height issues)
  - **Full custom DIY** — ✓ CHOSEN — build boxes to exact height needed
  - ~~J Collection from Home Depot~~ — backup option if time gets tight

- [ ] **Decide on cabinet face orientation/layout**
  - How many doors vs drawers?
  - Open shelves on top? (looks airy, LED-friendly)
  - Farmhouse X-panel? Shaker? Sliding barn door style?
  - *Note: Living room side is what guests see — this is the "money shot"*

- [x] **Lock in total bar height** ✓ 40" CONFIRMED
  - **40" total** (from kitchen floor)
  - **Custom build math:** 40" - 1.5" butcher block - 4" toe kick = **34.5" cabinet body**

### Butcher Block

- [ ] **Decide: chevron or plain?**
  - Chevron max retail thickness = 1.5"
  - Plain slabs available up to 7.5"
  - *Note: If chevron is important, lamination (chevron + plain substrate) gets you 2.5" thickness*

- [ ] **Decide: single slab or join multiple pieces?**
  - Your size: 92" x 30"
  - Lowe's chevron is 72" x 39" — would need joining for length
  - *Note: Titebond III + countertop bolts is rock solid for joining*

- [ ] **Finalize butcher block sourcing**
  - Ready-made chevron: Lowe's Allen + Roth ($400) or Home Depot Hardwood Reflections
  - Custom thick slab: Country Mouldings, Armani Fine Woodworking
  - *Note: See `docs/research/2026-01-08-butcher-block-sourcing.md` for all options*

## Phase 2: Research & Learning
*Custom build confirmed — this is your playbook*

### Cabinet Building Techniques
*CRITICAL SECTION — learn these before cutting*

- [ ] **Watch cabinet building tutorials**
  - Woodshop Diaries: Basic plywood cabinets (beginner-friendly)
  - MWA Woodworks: Professional method
  - South House Designs: Cabinet bar with open shelves (matches your vision!)
  - *Note: URLs are in `docs/research/2026-01-08-cabinet-options.md`*

- [ ] **Research simple DIY box construction**
  - Kreg pocket hole method = easiest approach
  - Basic box = 2 sides + bottom + back + face frame (5 pieces)
  - No fancy joinery needed — pocket screws do the work
  - *Note: Custom boxes mean you control the EXACT height (no weird platform needed)*

- [ ] **Look up cheats/tricks for cabinet building**
  - Pocket hole jigs (Kreg K5 or similar) eliminate complex joinery
  - Edge banding hides plywood edges
  - Pre-made hinges/drawer slides do the hard work
  - *Note: Search YouTube for "easy cabinet building hacks"*

- [ ] **Research door building options**
  - Buy pre-made Shaker doors (Cabinet Now, Cabinet Door World)
  - DIY with PVC/LVP flooring panels (you mentioned this!)
  - Build from scratch with rail-and-stile router bits
  - *Note: Buying pre-made saves a lot of time. PVC flooring is clever — waterproof and cheap*

---

## Phase 3: Planning & Lists
*Get these right and the build goes smoothly*

### Materials Planning

- [ ] **Create cut list**
  - All plywood pieces with dimensions
  - Base platform lumber cuts
  - Facing panel pieces
  - *Note: Do this AFTER final dimensions are locked*

- [ ] **Create shopping list**
  - Plywood: 3/4" birch or maple (cabinet boxes)
  - Lumber: 2x4s (base platform), 1x2s/1x3s (face frame, trim)
  - Hardware: soft-close hinges, drawer slides, Kreg screws, pocket hole screws
  - Finishing: primer, paint, polyurethane, edge banding
  - *Note: Custom build = more plywood, less prefab components*

### Build Documentation

- [ ] **Create building diagrams/models**
  - Front view (living room side)
  - Side profile (showing heights)
  - Exploded view (how pieces fit together)
  - *Note: Use the visualization app to generate views, or sketch by hand*

- [ ] **Create step-by-step build guide**
  - Week 1 tasks
  - Week 2 tasks
  - Finishing weekend
  - *Note: Break into half-day chunks so progress feels achievable*

- [ ] **Create implementation plan**
  - Tool checklist
  - Order of operations
  - What can be done simultaneously?
  - *Note: General sequence — base platform → cabinet boxes → facing → doors → top → finishing*

---

## Phase 4: Sourcing Trips
*See things in person before buying*

- [ ] **Visit Home Depot (priority)**
  - **Plywood:** 3/4" birch or maple sheets (cabinet boxes)
  - **Lumber:** 2x4s, 1x2s, 1x3s
  - **Hardware:** soft-close hinges, drawer slides, Kreg pocket hole jig + screws
  - **Glue:** Titebond III
  - **Edge banding:** iron-on birch veneer
  - *Note: Get plywood cut to rough size in-store (easier to transport)*

- [ ] **Visit Lowe's**
  - See chevron butcher block in person (Allen + Roth)
  - Check actual color/grain
  - *Note: Call ahead to confirm in stock*

- [ ] **Kitchen Express (Erie Blvd)**
  - Local option from your brief
  - Worth checking for cabinet/countertop options

- [ ] **Source local hardwood (if DIY butcher block)**
  - Find local lumber yard for 8/4 maple or oak
  - Get quotes on acacia if available
  - *Note: Google "[your city] hardwood lumber dealer"*

---

## Phase 5: Build Prep
*Set yourself up for success*

- [ ] **Clean out garage / make workspace**
  - Need flat surface for glue-ups
  - Space for assembly
  - *Note: You mentioned Saturday for dump run — do this first!*

- [ ] **Gather/verify tools**
  - Table saw ✓ (you have)
  - Miter saw ✓ (you have)
  - Router ✓ (you have)
  - Kreg pocket hole jig (buy/borrow?)
  - Bar clamps (need 6-8 for lamination)
  - Brad nailer
  - *Note: You have the big stuff — pocket hole jig is the key rental/purchase*

- [ ] **Buy/gather finishing supplies**
  - Waterlox Original Satin (recommended for butcher block)
  - OR Rubio Monocoat (one-coat option)
  - Paint for cabinet body (if not staining)

---

## Phase 6: Special Features (Scope Later)
*Nice-to-haves — add after the main build works*

- [ ] **LED strip placement planning**
  - Under countertop overhang (mood lighting)
  - Inside cabinets (practical + looks fancy)
  - Open shelf sections
  - *Note: Run wiring BEFORE installing countertop*

- [ ] **Foot rail**
  - Bar rail brackets + brass/pipe rail
  - Mount under overhang on kitchen side
  - *Note: This is on your "decided" list — don't forget it!*

- [ ] **Electrical outlets**
  - Need outlets in countertop for laptops
  - Pop-up outlet? Flush mount?
  - *Note: Plan wiring early — hard to add later*

- [ ] **Decorative corbels**
  - Support the overhang
  - Add farmhouse character
  - *Note: Buy pre-made from Home Depot or Etsy*

- [ ] **Secret compartment/hidden storage**
  - False drawer front?
  - Hidden shelf behind panel?
  - *Note: Fun project for later — plan the space now*

- [ ] **X-frame detail on side panel**
  - Farmhouse signature detail
  - Goes on the "walk-up" side
  - *Note: Simple to add with 1x2s or 1x3s*

---

## Phase 7: Research Resources

- [ ] **Check GitHub for relevant projects**
  - Woodworking plans/calculators?
  - 3D modeling tools?
  - Cut list generators?
  - *Note: Search "cabinet calculator" or "woodworking planner"*

- [ ] **Quality/appearance tips research**
  - How to get crisp paint lines
  - Sanding between coats
  - Proper grain filler for oak
  - Hardware alignment tricks
  - *Note: The details make it look "pro" vs "DIY"*

---

## Outstanding Questions (From Project Brief)

- [ ] **Is the column structural?**
  - Current metal railing has a support column
  - Can it be removed or must it be incorporated?
  - *Note: May need contractor opinion if unsure*

- [ ] **What cabinet finish approach?**
  - Paint (easiest, modern farmhouse friendly)
  - Stain + poly (shows wood grain)
  - Two-tone (painted body, stained doors)

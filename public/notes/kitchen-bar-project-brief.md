# The Kitchen Bar Project

## What's This All About?

You know that metal railing between my kitchen and living room? I'm replacing it with a bar.

The tricky part: my kitchen is about **2 feet higher** than the living room (split-level life). So this isn't a normal bar build - it's part bar, part storage cabinet, part "how do I make this not look weird."

**Seating is on the kitchen side**, looking out over the living room - kind of like sitting on a balcony. I'm calling it the "balcony bar effect" and I think it's going to be great for hanging out while someone's cooking.

## Where I'm At Right Now

I've got the basic layout figured out (check out the visualization tool - that's what this whole app is for). Now I'm focused on three things:

1. **Modern farmhouse aesthetic** - how do I nail this look?
2. **Cabinet face architecture** - this is the big one (see below)
3. **Finalizing dimensions** - making sure everything feels right

### The Cabinet Face Problem (I Need Help Here!)

I don't want this to look too boxy or like a kitchen island that got lost. The cabinet face is what everyone will see from the living room, so it needs to look intentional.

**I'm thinking about a layered approach:**
- **Top row:** Open shelving with LED lighting (display stuff, looks airy)
- **Bottom row:** Drawers or doors (practical storage)

**But what's the layout?** Something like...
- `[glass] [door] [drawer]` repeated?
- `[open shelf] [open shelf] [doors below]`?
- Symmetrical or asymmetrical?

I honestly don't know what will look best. If you have opinions or examples, send them my way!

## The Quick Stats

| What | Measurement |
|------|-------------|
| Step height | 23.5" (can't change this - it's my floor) |
| Bar length | ~84" (fits 3 people comfortably) |
| Bar depth | 28" total |
| Bar top | Butcher block, 1.5" thick |
| Bar height | ~40" |

From the **living room side**, the bar top will be about 5 feet up - so it's more like a half-wall with storage than a traditional bar.

## What This Bar Needs To Do

Basically everything:
- Homework station
- Work-from-home spot
- Eating meals
- Hanging out while cooking
- Extra seating when people are over

Oh, and I need **electrical outlets** in the top for laptops and charging. Non-negotiable.

## What's Already Decided

- **Pedestal/toe-kick base** - This is happening. It adds dimension and keeps the whole thing from looking like a big box sitting on the floor. Makes it feel lighter and more furniture-like.
- **Butcher block top** - Probably chevron pattern
- **Overhang** toward living room (at least 3") - Adds dimension, less boxy

## Stuff I'm Into

Features I want to incorporate:

- **Mixed cabinet style** - some open shelves, some closed
- LED lights (under overhang + inside cabinets)
- **Foot rail** under the bar top
- Decorative corbels for support

---

## Big Decisions I Haven't Made Yet

1. **The column** - There's a support column in the current railing. Is it structural? Can I remove it or should I incorporate it into the design?

2. **Cabinet finish** - How can we do a proper 'modern farmhouse' look?

3. **How fancy to get** - Keep it simple or add features like a tiered top, herb garden, fancy lighting?

## Help Me Out!

Play with the visualization, check out the reference photos, and let me know what you think.

**What I really need help with:**
- **Cabinet face layout** - What combination of glass/doors/drawers/open shelves would look best?
- **Modern farmhouse tips** - How do I make this feel cohesive with that aesthetic?
- **Dimension checks** - Does anything look off or feel wrong in the visualization?

Or just hit me with "have you considered..." ideas. I'm all ears!

Thanks for looking!

## 2026-01-09: Gate 0 - Column Assessment
Decision: UNCERTAIN
Notes: 
The column stud doesn't go into the soffet. I think we might be okay but I'm going to get a second opinion from my contractor friend. Semi-blocked so far.

## 2026-01-09: Reference Photos

- Reminder: These are used for structural analysis only. I don't want design decisions or recommendations based on how the kitchen looks now.

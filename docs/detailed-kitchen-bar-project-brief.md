# Kitchen Bar Project Brief

## Project Overview

I want to replace an existing metal railing in my split-level home with a bar that includes cabinet storage. The kitchen sits higher than the adjacent living room, creating a unique opportunity for a multi-functional bar/counter space.

This is sometimes called a "split-level kitchen bar," "stepped kitchen peninsula," or "raised kitchen bar with storage."

## Current Space Details

### Measurements

- **Step height:** 23.5 inches (living room floor to kitchen floor)
- **Railing span to replace:** ~92s inches
- **Desired bar depth:** At least 25 inches

### Current Features

- Metal decorative railing with scrollwork separates the kitchen from the living room
- There is a support column (believed to be removable/non-structural, but needs verification)

### Layout

- Standing in the living room, you look up into the kitchen
- The kitchen is on the right when facing the railing
- There are stairs going up on the left side
- Steps lead up from living room into the kitchen on the right side of the railing

## Project Goals

### Primary Uses for the Bar

1. Homework station
2. Working from home
3. Eating meals
4. Seating in kitchen while cooking
5. Extra place for chatting/socializing

### Seating Arrangement

- **Seating will be on the KITCHEN side** (not the living room side)
- People sitting at the bar will look out into the living room (like a balcony bar effect)
- Need seating for approximately 3-4 people (based on 84" length at 24" per person)

### Material Preferences

- **Bar top:** Butcher block
- **Cabinet style:** Open to options, but "mixed" style (combination of open shelving and closed doors/drawers) is appealing

### Features to Include

- **Electrical outlets** in the bar top for laptops and device charging
- Considering **under-cabinet LED lighting**

## Key Measurements & Ergonomics

### Comfortable Bar Dimensions

- **Bar height:** 40-42 inches (from floor where you're sitting)
- **Counter height:** 36 inches
- **Stool height for bar:** 28-30 inches
- **Stool height for counter:** 24-26 inches
- **Seat-to-bar-top distance:** 10-14 inches (ideal)
- **Knee clearance depth:** 12+ inches (minimum for comfort)
- **Seating width:** 24 inches per person

## Summary

The core challenge is creating a functional bar with storage that works with the 23.5" elevation change between kitchen and living room. Seating is on the kitchen side, looking out to the living room. The bar needs to serve multiple purposes (homework, meals, work, socializing) and should include electrical for devices. Butcher block top is desired. The design should balance functionality, aesthetics, and construction complexity.

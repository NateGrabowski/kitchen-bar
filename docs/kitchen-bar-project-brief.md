# Kitchen Bar Project Brief

## Project Overview

I want to replace an existing metal railing in my split-level home with a bar that includes cabinet storage. The kitchen sits higher than the adjacent living room, creating a unique opportunity for a multi-functional bar/counter space.

This is sometimes called a "split-level kitchen bar," "stepped kitchen peninsula," or "raised kitchen bar with storage."

---

## Current Space Details

### Measurements
- **Step height:** 23.5 inches (living room floor to kitchen floor)
- **Railing span to replace:** ~84 inches (7 feet)
- **Desired bar depth:** At least 25 inches

### Current Features
- Metal decorative railing with scrollwork separates the kitchen from the living room
- There is a support column (believed to be removable/non-structural, but needs verification)
- Kitchen has honey oak cabinets
- There is a dark island/cart currently in the kitchen
- Pet water bowls are located near the step area
- White Christmas tree and decorative goose near the step (seasonal)

### Layout
- Standing in the living room, you look up into the kitchen
- The kitchen is on the right when facing the railing
- There are stairs going up on the left side
- Steps lead up from living room into the kitchen on the right side of the railing

## Project Goals

### Primary Uses for the Bar
1. Homework station
2. Working from home
3. Eating meals
4. Seating in kitchen while cooking
5. Extra place for chatting/socializing

### Seating Arrangement
- **Seating will be on the KITCHEN side** (not the living room side)
- People sitting at the bar will look out into the living room (like a balcony bar effect)
- Need seating for approximately 3-4 people (based on 84" length at 24" per person)

### Material Preferences
- **Bar top:** Butcher block
- **Cabinet style:** Open to options, but "mixed" style (combination of open shelving and closed doors/drawers) is appealing
- **Cabinet finish:** No strong preference yet—could match existing honey oak or contrast with a darker finish

### Features to Include
- **Electrical outlets** in the bar top for laptops and device charging
- Considering **under-cabinet LED lighting**

## Design Configurations Explored

### Option A: Living-Room-Side Cabinets (Original Concept)
Cabinets mount on the living room side of the step, accessible from the living room. Bar top extends over with knee clearance on the kitchen side for seating.

**Key features:**
- Cabinets face INTO the living room (storage accessible from living room)
- Bar height is independently adjustable (not tied to cabinet height)
- Requires custom framing/construction hanging off the step
- Steel L-brackets needed to support knee-space overhang
- Cabinet height can be very tall (60+ inches from living room floor)
- "Cabinet setback" option tucks cabinets under the bar top, creating an overhang on the living room side

**Pros:**
- Maximum flexibility for bar height
- Living room storage/display
- Can create a floating bar top effect

**Cons:**
- More complex construction
- Requires structural support brackets
- Custom build (not standard cabinets)

---

### Option B: Kitchen-Floor Cabinets
Standard base cabinets sit on the kitchen floor, with bar top extending toward living room and overhanging into kitchen for seating.

**Sub-options explored:**

#### B1: Flush Peninsula
- Cabinets align with step edge
- Bar overhangs into kitchen only
- Living room sees finished back panel
- Simplest construction

#### B2: Setback Peninsula  
- Cabinets pulled back from step edge
- Step remains visible as natural boundary
- Creates landing zone at step level

#### B3: Tiered/Two-Level Top
- Lower counter section (~36") for prep
- Raised bar section (~42") toward living room for seating
- Solves the "counter height isn't bar height" problem
- Raised section hides kitchen mess from bar sitters

#### B4: Ledge + Cabinets (Hybrid)
- Kitchen-floor cabinets with kitchen-side seating
- PLUS separate shelf/ledge mounted on living room side of step
- Ledge at standing height (~42" from LR floor) for drinks, leaning
- Two separate elements, can be phased

#### B5: Upper + Lower (Hybrid)
- Kitchen-floor base cabinets
- PLUS floating display shelves on living room side
- Kitchen storage AND living room display (books, plants, decor)

**Pros of kitchen-floor approach:**
- Standard base cabinet construction
- Easier to install
- More structural support for heavy countertop
- Simpler overall

**Cons:**
- Bar height limited to cabinet height + top (~36" standard)
- Need raiser or tiered top to reach bar height (40-42")
- Less/no functionality from living room side (unless hybrid approach)

## Key Measurements & Ergonomics

### Comfortable Bar Dimensions
- **Bar height:** 40-42 inches (from floor where you're sitting)
- **Counter height:** 36 inches
- **Stool height for bar:** 28-30 inches
- **Stool height for counter:** 24-26 inches
- **Seat-to-bar-top distance:** 10-14 inches (ideal)
- **Knee clearance depth:** 12+ inches (minimum for comfort)
- **Seating width:** 24 inches per person

### Height Calculations from Living Room
With 23.5" step + bar elements, the bar top appears quite tall from living room:
- 23.5" step + 36" counter = 59.5" from living room floor
- 23.5" step + 42" bar = 65.5" from living room floor

This means from the living room side, it functions more like a half-wall than a bar.

### Butcher Block Considerations
- Minimum 1.5" thickness recommended for 84" span
- Support brackets every 24-36 inches
- Allow 1/8" gap at walls for wood expansion
- Seal with food-safe finish (oil or polyurethane)

## Electrical Planning

- Plan for 2-3 duplex outlets along bar top
- Consider USB charging ports
- Pop-up outlets keep surface clean
- Low-voltage wiring for LED strip lighting
- Run conduit/wiring before closing up framing

---

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

1. **Is the support column structural?** — Needs verification before deciding to remove or incorporate
2. **Cabinet facing direction** — If kitchen-floor cabinets, should doors face kitchen (convenient) or could some face living room?
3. **Match or contrast existing cabinets?** — Honey oak match vs. darker contrast
4. **Hybrid approach?** — Worth adding living-room-side elements (ledge, shelves) or keep it simple?
5. **Tiered top?** — Worth the added complexity for true bar height?

## Files Created During Planning

Interactive visualization tools were created to explore these options:
1. `kitchen-bar-planner-v3.jsx` — Original concept with living-room-side cabinets, adjustable dimensions, construction details
2. `kitchen-floor-cabinet-options.jsx` — Kitchen-floor cabinet configurations with different facing options
3. `hybrid-bar-options.jsx` — Five different approaches comparing flush, setback, tiered, and hybrid configurations

Bar top height:        40" (from kitchen floor) — flexible, could go 36-42"
Total bar depth:       28"
Cabinet depth:         12" (if LR-side) or 24" (if kitchen-floor standard base)
Cabinet setback:       3" (tucked under bar top)
Bar length:            84"
Stool height:          30"
Bar top thickness:     1.5" (butcher block)
Kitchen overhang:      12" (for knee clearance when seating on kitchen side)
```

## Spatial Context & Layout Description

**For future sessions without access to photos:**

### Viewing from the Living Room (looking toward kitchen):
- The kitchen is ELEVATED, sitting about 2 feet higher than the living room
- A decorative black metal railing with scrollwork currently separates the two spaces
- The railing runs horizontally for about 7 feet
- To the RIGHT of the railing: 2-3 steps lead up into the kitchen
- To the LEFT: the living room continues, with a couch and TV visible
- A white support column sits at one end of the railing where it meets the step-up area
- There's a decorative white goose figure near the base of the column
- Pet water/food bowls sit on the kitchen floor just behind the railing

### The Kitchen (elevated level):
- Traditional style with honey oak cabinets
- Stainless steel refrigerator visible in the back
- Glass-front upper cabinets
- Tile flooring (beige/tan octagonal pattern)
- A dark-colored kitchen island/cart with red appliances on top (stand mixer, etc.)
- White appliances (stove, microwave)
- Window over the sink area on the right side

### The Railing Details:
- Black wrought iron style
- Vertical bars with decorative scroll elements in the center
- Curved handrail on the step-up side
- Currently has a metal track at the bottom (possibly from a previous baby gate)
- Blue painter's tape on the floor marks something (possibly measurement reference)

## Expressed Preferences & Reactions

### Things You Liked:
- **Mixed cabinet style** — combination of open shelving and closed storage is appealing
- **Cabinet setback idea** — tucking cabinets under the bar creates visual lightness and a usable overhang
- **Under-cabinet lighting** — interested in including this
- **The "balcony bar" effect** — seating in kitchen looking out over living room

### Things to Explore Further:
- **Tiered/two-level top** — worth considering for getting true bar height while using standard base cabinets
- **Hybrid approaches** — adding a living-room-side ledge for drinks/leaning is interesting
- **Open shelving on back** — if cabinets face kitchen, having open display shelving on the living room side

### Undecided:
- Cabinet finish (match honey oak vs. contrast)
- Whether to remove the column or incorporate it
- Final bar height (36" counter vs. 40-42" bar height)
- Which overall configuration to pursue

## Configuration Comparison Quick Reference

| Configuration | Bar Height | LR Storage | Complexity | Best For |
|---------------|------------|------------|------------|----------|
| LR-side cabinets (original) | Adjustable | Yes | High | Max flexibility |
| Flush peninsula | ~36" | No | Low | Simplicity |
| Setback peninsula | ~36" | No | Low | Keeping step visible |
| Tiered top | 36" + 42" | No | Medium | Two work heights |
| Ledge + cabinets | ~36" + ledge | Ledge only | Medium | LR drink ledge |
| Upper + lower | ~36" | Display shelves | Medium | Display storage |

## For Future Redesigns

When making adjustments, key variables to play with:

1. **Bar height** — Affects stool selection and comfort. 36" = counter stools, 42" = bar stools
2. **Cabinet depth** — 12" for shallow storage/display, 24" for full base cabinets
3. **Overhang** — Need 12"+ for comfortable knee clearance
4. **Cabinet setback** — 0" = flush, 3-6" = tucked under for visual interest
5. **Tiered option** — Adds 4-8" raised section for bar height

If photos are available, upload them for visual reference. The three original photos showed:
- Image 1: Wide view from living room showing railing, white Christmas tree, kitchen beyond
- Image 2: View from kitchen side showing railing, step down, living room with TV
- Image 3: Similar to Image 1, slightly different angle, clearer view of kitchen layout

## Summary

The core challenge is creating a functional bar with storage that works with the 23.5" elevation change between kitchen and living room. Seating is on the kitchen side, looking out to the living room. The bar needs to serve multiple purposes (homework, meals, work, socializing) and should include electrical for devices. Butcher block top is desired. The design should balance functionality, aesthetics, and construction complexity.

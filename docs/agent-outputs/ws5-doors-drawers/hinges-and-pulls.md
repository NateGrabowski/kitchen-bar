## Design Considerations

### Hole Center Selection (Drawer Pulls)

**Drawer face dimensions:** 29.5" W × ~10" H (each drawer)

**5" hole center recommendation:**
- **Pros:** Proportional to 29.5" width, modern look, standard size
- **Cons:** None for this size drawer

**Alternative 3.75" centers:**
- **Pros:** Slightly more compact
- **Cons:** May look undersized on 29.5" wide drawers

**Recommendation:** Stick with 5" (128mm) hole center for proper proportion.

---

### Pull Placement

**Drawer pulls:**
- **Horizontal:** Center of each drawer face
- **Vertical:** Typically centered, or slightly above center for ergonomics

**Cabinet door pulls:**
- **Horizontal:** Centered on door width
- **Vertical:** Upper third of door (~24" from bottom of 34.5" door) for comfortable reach
- **Alternative:** Mid-height (~17" from bottom) for symmetry

---

### Hinge Quantity

**Standard rule:** 2 hinges per door up to 40" height

**Our doors:** 34.5" H - 2 hinges per door sufficient
**Total:** 2 doors × 2 hinges = 4 hinges needed

---

## Finish Matching Notes

All recommended products use matte black finish, but expect slight variations:

- **Blum Black Onyx:** Smooth satin matte black with slight sheen
- **Ravinte hinges:** Powder coat matte black (slightly textured)
- **Ravinte pulls:** Stainless steel with matte black powder coat
- **SMARTSTANDARD:** Powder coat matte black (consistent with Ravinte)

**All finishes are compatible and will read as "matte black" in the final assembly.** Minor texture/sheen differences are normal and expected when mixing brands.

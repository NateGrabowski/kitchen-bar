## BARN DOOR SECTION: Pre-Made vs DIY Analysis

### Option A: Pre-Made X-Panel Barn Door

**Searched sources:**
- Home Depot, Lowes: Standard barn door sizes (24", 30", 32", 36" widths)
- Online barn door retailers: Mostly standard sizes

**30" × 34.5" custom barn door availability:** **NONE FOUND**

**Standard barn door sizes:**
- **Width:** 24", 30", 32", 36", 42" (most common)
- **Height:** 80", 84", 96" (full door height)

**Our requirement:** 30" W × 34.5" H (cabinet height, not full-size door)

**Closest standard sizes:**
- 30" × 84" - FAR too tall (need to cut 49.5" off)
- 24" × 80" - Too narrow and too tall

**Custom barn door ordering:**
- Some retailers offer custom sizes
- Typical minimum height: 60-72" (still too tall for our 34.5" need)
- Custom 30" × 34.5" pricing: $150-300+ if available (not found in research)

**Conclusion:** Pre-made X-panel barn door in 30" × 34.5" **NOT AVAILABLE** at reasonable cost.

  - Need: 8-10 linear feet (two 48" diagonals)
  - Cost: $6-10
- **1×3 or 1×4 for perimeter trim (optional):**
  - If adding frame around edges

---

#### Build Process

**Step 1: Cut boards to length**
- Five 1×6 boards × 35.5" length (slightly oversized, trim after assembly)
- Two diagonal X-braces (cut to fit after face assembly)

**Step 2: Assemble door face**
- Lay five 1×6 boards edge-to-edge
- Apply construction adhesive between boards
- Clamp together until dry (follow adhesive instructions)
- Optionally: Brad nail or pocket screw from back for extra strength

**Step 3: Mark and cut X-brace**
- Measure diagonals corner-to-corner
- Cut 1×4 boards to fit with 45° miter at ends (for clean corners)
- Test fit before adhering

**Step 4: Attach X-brace**
- Apply construction adhesive to back of X-brace boards
- Press onto front face of door
- Nail or screw through face into braces (will be puttied and painted)
- Let adhesive cure per manufacturer instructions (typically 24 hours)

**Step 5: Trim to final size**
- Once adhesive fully cured, trim door to exactly 30" × 34.5"
- Use circular saw with straight edge guide
- Sand all edges smooth

**Step 6: Finishing**
- Fill all nail holes and gaps with wood filler
- Sand entire door smooth (120-grit, then 220-grit)
- Prime all surfaces (front, back, edges)

- **Paint-grade:** Pine accepts paint well
- **Modern farmhouse aesthetic:** X-panel perfect for style

#### DIY Barn Door Cons

- **Weight considerations:** Solid wood will be ~20-25 lbs (within hardware spec)
- **Potential warping:** Pine can warp if not properly sealed on all surfaces
- **Adhesive dependency:** Relies on construction adhesive for board bonding

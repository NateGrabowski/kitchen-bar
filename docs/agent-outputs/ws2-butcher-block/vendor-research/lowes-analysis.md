## Fit for Our 92" x 30" Bar

### Size Analysis
- **Length:** 72" (20" SHORT of our 92" requirement)
- **Width:** 39" (9" WIDER than our 30" requirement)

### Solutions
1. **Join two slabs:** Buy 72" x 39" + 24" x 39" extension, join with countertop bolts
2. **Trim to fit:** Cut 39" width down to 30" (leaves 9" waste for other projects)
3. **Consider 8ft option:** Buy 96" x 25" chevron instead (solves length, but 5" narrower)

## Pros
- ✓ Exact chevron pattern match to idea5.jpg reference photo
- ✓ Light acacia wood fits modern farmhouse aesthetic
- ✓ Best current price at $349 (20% off sale)
- ✓ FSC certified sustainable sourcing
- ✓ 39" width perfect - trim to 30" and have extra for cutting boards/shelves
- ✓ Available immediately at local Lowe's
- ✓ Can be finished with Waterlox or Rubio Monocoat per preference

## Cons
- ✗ Only 1.5" thick (may require lamination for 2"+ thickness goal)
- ✗ 20" too short - requires joining a second piece or adjusting bar design
- ✗ Finger-jointed construction (not solid planks, though still quality)
- ✗ Unfinished - requires DIY finishing (time investment)

## Installation Notes
- Requires 72-hour acclimation before installation
- Must allow for wood movement (expands up to 3/16" across width)
- Use figure-8 fasteners or slotted brackets (not rigid mounting)
- Apply mineral oil or Waterlox finish (3-5 coats)

## Overall Assessment

**Rating: 9/10 for project fit**

This is the best match for the chevron aesthetic at the best price point. The 72" length limitation is solvable by:
- Joining with a 24" extension piece using draw bolts + Titebond III
- Or accepting a 72" bar (adjusting design)

The 1.5" thickness can be addressed by face-laminating with a 1" substrate to achieve 2.5" total thickness (as outlined in hybrid approach from research).

**Recommendation:** Buy this slab + laminate substrate approach for best value with exact look desired.

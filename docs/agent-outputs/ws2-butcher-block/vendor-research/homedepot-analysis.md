## Fit for Our 92" x 30" Bar

### Size Analysis
- **Length:** 98" (6" LONGER than our 92" requirement - perfect for trimming)
- **Width:** 25" (5" NARROWER than our 30" requirement)

### Solutions
1. **Accept 25" depth:** Adjust bar design for narrower countertop (larger overhang on living room side)
2. **Join two slabs side-by-side:** Buy two 98" x 25" and join to make 98" x 50", then trim to 92" x 30"
3. **Laminate with wider substrate:** Use 25" chevron on top, wider plain substrate underneath

## Pros
- ✓ Length is perfect at 98" (trim 6" for exact 92" fit)
- ✓ Chevron pattern matches aesthetic goal
- ✓ Hevea is sustainable, durable, and planet-friendly
- ✓ Light golden tone fits modern farmhouse style
- ✓ From maple family (desirable hardwood characteristics)
- ✓ Resistant to warping and cracking
- ✓ Available at Home Depot (widespread availability)

## Cons
- ✗ Only 1.5" thick (same limitation as Lowe's option)
- ✗ 25" width is 5" too narrow (significant design compromise)
- ✗ Hevea/Rubberwood less prestigious than acacia (though comparable quality)
- ✗ Requires joining two slabs OR accepting narrower design
- ✗ Price not confirmed in current search (need to verify)

## Cost Analysis (Estimated)

### Option 1: Single 98" x 25" slab
- **Cost:** ~$400-500 (estimated)
- **Result:** 92" x 25" counter (5" narrower than goal)

### Option 2: Two 98" x 25" slabs joined
- **Cost:** ~$800-1,000 (estimated)
- **Result:** 92" x 50" raw (trim to 92" x 30")
- **Waste:** 20" x 92" extra material

Option 2 is expensive and wasteful unless you have use for significant scrap material.

## Installation Notes
- Same wood movement considerations as other butcher blocks
- Use figure-8 fasteners with 24-30" spacing
- 72-hour acclimation required
- Hevea takes stain well if darker tone desired

## Overall Assessment

**Rating: 6/10 for project fit**

The length is ideal (better than Lowe's 72"), but the 25" width creates a significant challenge. This option only makes sense if:
1. You're willing to adjust the bar design to 25" depth, OR
2. You're willing to buy and join two slabs (expensive and wasteful)

The Lowe's 72" x 39" is superior because:
- 39" width easily trims to 30" with useful waste
- Acacia is slightly more desirable than Hevea/Rubberwood
- Confirmed lower price at $349

**Recommendation:** Only choose this over Lowe's if you prefer the 98" length enough to solve the width problem, or if you want the living room side to have a larger overhang (accepting 25" depth).

## Fit for Our 92" x 30" Bar

### Size Analysis
**None of the available sizes meet our requirements:**
- Longest available: 60"L (32" SHORT of our 92" requirement)
- Best width match: 30"W (PERFECT, but only available in 48" length)

### Solutions
1. **Join multiple pieces:** Buy (2) 48"L x 30"W slabs, join to make 96"L x 30"W, trim to 92"
2. **Mix and match:** Not practical due to size limitations
3. **Look elsewhere:** Wayfair doesn't carry the size needed

## Pros
- ✓ Premium quality with hand-selected hardwood
- ✓ Minimal knots (higher grade than some retail options)
- ✓ 48" x 30" option has perfect width
- ✓ Pre-finished options available (save DIY time)
- ✓ Chevron pattern matches aesthetic
- ✓ Good customer reviews
- ✓ Delivered to your door

## Cons
- ✗ Maximum length is only 60" (way too short)
- ✗ Would require joining 2+ pieces to reach 92" (expensive)
- ✗ No advantage over Lowe's or Home Depot for this project
- ✗ Price range unclear without selecting specific size/finish
- ✗ Potential confusion with finishes (walnut finish is stained acacia, not real walnut)
- ✗ Shipping costs and times may add delay

## Cost Analysis (Estimated)

### Option: Join two 48" x 30" slabs
- **Cost per slab:** ~$350-500 (estimated, varies by finish)
- **Total cost:** ~$700-1,000 for two slabs
- **Result:** 96" x 30" (trim to 92")
- **Comparison:** More expensive than Lowe's single 72" x 39" at $349

This approach is not cost-effective.

## Overall Assessment

**Rating: 3/10 for project fit**

Wayfair does not offer practical solutions for a 92" countertop. While they have quality products with the chevron pattern, the size limitations make this vendor unsuitable for this project. The 48" x 30" option would require buying and joining two slabs at significant expense.

**Key Issues:**
- Too short (max 60" length)
- Joining required = higher cost + more complexity
- No advantage over Lowe's/Home Depot retail options

**Recommendation:** Skip Wayfair for this project. The Lowe's option is superior in both size availability and price.

## Alternative Wayfair Options

Wayfair does carry some 8ft+ options in other brands:
- **Latitude Run® 8ft/98" Butcher Block in Unfinished Acacia Chevron Wood** was found in search results
  - This could be worth investigating if it's available and priced competitively
  - Need to verify exact dimensions and pricing

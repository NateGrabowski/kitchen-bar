- **Species:** Maple or White Oak (light, clean, modern farmhouse)
- **Size:** 92" L x 30" W x 2" thick
- **Construction:** Edge grain
- **Edge Profile:** Eased edge or 1/8" roundover (not heavy profile)
- **Finish:** Unfinished (apply Waterlox satin yourself)

**Estimated Total Cost:** $500-700 + shipping (~$100-200) = **$600-900 total**

## Overall Assessment

**Rating: 7/10 for project fit**

**Strengths:**
- Perfect for custom sizing and thickness goals
- Quality construction from established vendor
- Transparent pricing with instant quotes

**Weaknesses:**
- Cannot provide chevron pattern (deal-breaker if chevron is non-negotiable)
- More expensive than retail chevron options
- Requires waiting 2-3 weeks vs immediate retail pickup

**Recommendation:** Use Country Mouldings if you're willing to give up the chevron pattern in exchange for exact sizing, thicker profile (2"+), and higher quality edge grain construction. This is a **fallback option** if chevron isn't achievable or if you decide thick plain slab is better for durability.

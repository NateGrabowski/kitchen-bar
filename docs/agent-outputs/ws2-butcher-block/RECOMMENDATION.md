---

## Why This Approach Wins

### ✅ Achieves All Design Goals

- Retail availability (immediate pickup vs. 2-3 week custom lead time)

### ✅ Proven Technique
- Face-lamination is established method
- Multiple forum users report success (workbenches, countertops)
- Stronger than single 2.5" slab (cross-grain glue bonds)

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Purchase & Acclimation (Week 1)

**Tasks:**
1. Buy Lowe's chevron acacia slab ($349)
2. Order Country Mouldings custom substrate 96" x 30" x 1" maple (~$250)
3. Purchase Titebond III, figure-8 fasteners, countertop bolts
4. Bring chevron slab home, unwrap, place in kitchen area
5. **Acclimate 72 hours minimum** (same environment as installation)
6. Wait for substrate to arrive (2-week lead time)

**Week 1 Subtotal:** ~$599 + shipping

### Phase 2: Lamination (Weekend, Week 3)

**Prep (Friday evening):**
1. Verify both slabs acclimated in same space 1-2 weeks
2. Clean both surfaces (no dust, oil, or finish)
3. Set up flat work surface (garage floor, large table)
4. Lay plastic or wax paper to prevent sticking
5. Gather clamps, cauls (straight boards), and glue

**Lamination (Saturday morning):**
1. Dry-fit slabs to verify alignment
2. Apply thin, even coat of Titebond III to both surfaces (use roller)
3. Carefully align chevron slab on top of substrate (no repositioning after contact!)
4. Clamp from center outward with cauls distributing pressure
5. Wipe excess glue squeeze-out immediately with damp cloth
6. **Let cure 24-48 hours** - do not move or unclamp

**Time:** 3-4 hours active work + 48 hours cure time

### Phase 3: Trimming & Edge Profiling (Week 4)

**Sunday or following weekend:**
1. Unclamp laminated slab
2. Trim to exact 92" length (if using 96" substrate)
3. Trim width to 30" (chevron slab is 39", substrate is 30")
4. **Router edge profile:** 1/4" roundover or chamfer on all edges
   - This hides the lamination seam and adds finished look
5. Sand edges smooth (120, 180, 220 grit progression)

**Tools needed:**
- Circular saw or track saw (for trimming)
- Router with roundover bit
- Orbital sander

**Time:** 3-4 hours

### Phase 4: Joining for 92" Length (Optional)

**If 72" chevron isn't long enough:**

**Option A: Join Two Chevron Pieces**
- Buy second 24" x 39" piece (may need 4ft slab, trim to 24")
- Use miter bolts + Titebond III to join 72" + 24" = 96" (trim to 92")
- Adds ~$200-300 to budget

**Option B: Adjust Bar Design**
- Accept 72" length instead of 92"
- Reduce bar length by 20"
- **Simplest solution if acceptable**

**RECOMMENDED:** Adjust design to 72" if feasible, or budget extra $250 for joining pieces.

### Phase 5: Finishing (Week 5)

**Finish options:**

**Option A: Waterlox Original Satin (RECOMMENDED)**
- 3-5 coats, sand between coats with 320 grit
- Durable, food-safe, water-resistant
- Matte/satin finish (modern farmhouse aesthetic)
- Cost: ~$60 for quart
- Time: 1 week (24 hours between coats)

**Option B: Rubio Monocoat**
- Single coat, easy application
- Natural matte finish
- Cost: ~$70-100
- Time: 48 hours cure

**Schedule:**
- Sand entire surface (120, 180, 220 grit)
- Vacuum dust thoroughly
- Apply first coat (brush or wipe on)
- Wait 24 hours, light sand with 320 grit
- Repeat 2-4 more times
- Final cure 7 days before installation

**Time:** 1 week (mostly waiting between coats)

### Phase 6: Installation (Week 6)

**Final steps:**
1. Verify cabinets are level and solid
2. Mark fixed centerline (front-to-back)
3. Install figure-8 fasteners every 24-30" around cabinet perimeter
4. Place countertop on cabinets
5. Secure fixed centerline with screws (tight)
6. Secure floating edges with figure-8s (snug, not tight)
7. Verify 1/16" air gap under countertop for airflow
8. Final inspection

**Time:** 2-3 hours

**Total project timeline:** 5-6 weeks (mostly waiting for substrate + cure times)
**Total active work time:** ~15-20 hours

---

## Alternative Recommendations

### Alternative 1: Accept 1.5" Thickness (Fastest)

**If 1.5" thickness is acceptable:**

**Buy:** Lowe's chevron 72" x 39" x 1.5" only ($349)

**Process:**
1. Trim to 72" x 30" (or join for 92" length)
2. Apply Waterlox finish
3. Install on cabinets

**Total cost:** $349-649 (depending on length solution)
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Pros:** Simplest, fastest, cheapest
**Cons:** Only 1.5" thick (may feel thin for substantial bar)

### Alternative 2: Custom Thick Slab (No Chevron)

**If thickness is more important than chevron:**

**Buy:** Country Mouldings custom 92" x 30" x 2" maple edge grain (~$600)

**Process:**
1. Order exact size, unfinished
2. Wait 2-3 weeks for delivery
3. Apply Waterlox finish
4. Install

**Total cost:** ~$660-700 (includes shipping + finish)
**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks
**Pros:** Exact sizing, true 2" thickness, quality construction
**Cons:** No chevron pattern (plain edge grain)

### Alternative 3: Premium Handcrafted (Maximum Impact)

**If budget allows and you want maximum impact:**

**Buy:** Armani Fine Woodworking custom 92" x 30" x 3" Calico Hickory edge grain (~$1,200-1,400)

**Process:**
1. Order custom spec (3" or thicker)
2. Wait 3 weeks for handcrafted fabrication
3. Apply Rubio Monocoat finish
4. Install

**Total cost:** ~$1,300-1,500
**Timeline:** 4-5 weeks
**Pros:** Premium quality, handcrafted, 3"+ thickness (dramatic impact)

## Installation Notes

### Wood Movement Accommodation
- Use figure-8 fasteners every 24-30" to allow cross-grain expansion (up to 1/4" seasonal)
- Fix centerline with tight screws
- Float all edges with snug (not tight) fasteners
- Maintain 1/16" air gap under countertop

### Joining Slabs (If Extending to 92")
- Use miter bolts/draw bolts + Titebond III
- Space bolts 12-18" apart
- Rout channels for bolts on underside
- Ensure perfect alignment before tightening

### Finishing Best Practices
- Apply finish to underside too (prevents one-sided moisture absorption)
- 3-5 coats Waterlox for maximum durability
- 7-day cure before installation
- Reapply mineral oil or Waterlox every 6-12 months

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Lamination Delamination
**Mitigation:**
- Use same wood species (both light woods: acacia + maple/oak)
- Match grain orientation (both face grain same direction)
- Acclimate both slabs together 1-2 weeks
- Use Titebond III (waterproof, food-safe)
- Adequate clamping pressure

**Evidence:** Multiple users on Fine Woodworking forums report success laminating IKEA slabs to 3" with no issues after years.

### Risk 2: Visible Lamination Seam on Edges
**Mitigation:**
- Router roundover or chamfer breaks up visual line
- 3" overhang on living room side hides edge from below
- Can add dark stain to edge as design feature
- Or apply thin edge banding to cover seam

### Risk 3: Wood Movement Causing Warping
**Mitigation:**
- Follow proper installation with slotted fasteners
- Don't over-tighten fasteners
- Apply finish to all surfaces (top, bottom, edges)
- Maintain stable humidity (30-50% RH)

### Risk 4: Chevron Slab Too Short (72" vs 92")
**Mitigation Options:**
1. Adjust bar design to 72" length (simplest)
2. Join second piece with miter bolts (adds $200-300)
3. Accept overhang on one end only

**Decision point:** Evaluate during Phase 1 after seeing 72" slab in space

## Recommendation: **Option B - Open Shelving Mix**

### Why This Option

#### 1. **Modern Farmhouse Aesthetic Match** (Primary Driver)
- The open shelving on top is a hallmark of modern farmhouse design
- Creates the mixed open/closed storage pattern referenced in design requirements
- Pairs beautifully with the butcher block top
- Aligns with reference images showing open display areas

#### 2. **Visual Interest & Proportions**
- Breaks up the long 90" horizontal expanse with vertical interest
- The 13" open shelf section (38% of total height) creates pleasing proportions
- Three equal compartments (30" each) provide rhythm and balance
- Avoids the "furniture bank" look of all-closed cabinets

#### 3. **Functional Benefits**
- **Display opportunities:** Cookbooks, plants, decorative items, serving pieces
- **Accessible storage:** Frequently-used items within easy reach
- **Visual depth:** Creates layers from living room view
- **Closed storage below:** Hides less attractive items, kitchen supplies, linens

#### 4. **Buildability with Pocket Hole Construction**
- Three equal doors (30" each) are easy to build and align
- Open shelf dividers use simple vertical partitions
- No drawer boxes needed (simplifies construction)
- Shaker-style doors are straightforward with pocket screws

#### 5. **Long-Term Flexibility**
- Shelves can be styled/restyled seasonally
- Easy to add LED strip lighting later (WS7)
- Can add cabinet doors to open section if preferences change
- Adaptable to changing decor needs

## Questions for Human Review

1. **Styling commitment:** Are you comfortable styling/maintaining open shelves, or would you prefer all-closed storage?

2. **Display items:** What would you envision displaying on the shelves? (cookbooks, plants, serving pieces, decorative items)

3. **Lighting:** Would you like to plan for LED strip lighting in the open shelf section now, or add later?

4. **Door preference:** All three options use Shaker-style doors. Any preference for:
   - Panel material (wood vs. MDF)
   - Door color (dark blue-gray as specified, or alternative)
   - Hardware style (knobs vs. pulls)

5. **Shelf material:** Should open shelves match the butcher block top exactly, or use complementary wood?

6. **Interior storage:** For the three closed cabinets below, do you want:
   - Fixed shelves
   - Adjustable shelves
   - Pull-out drawers/organizers

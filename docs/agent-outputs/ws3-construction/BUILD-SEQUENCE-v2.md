## Pre-Build Phase (Week 1)

### Step 0: Tool and Material Acquisition

**Tools to purchase:** (See updated tool-list.md and ADDENDUM-no-table-saw.md)

**NEW/UPDATED tools:**
- [ ] Kreg K5 pocket hole jig
- [ ] Pocket hole screws (500 count, coarse thread)
- [ ] 60-tooth circular saw blade (for plywood, NOT table saw)
- [ ] DIY straightedge guide materials OR Kreg Rip-Cut ($20-50)
- [ ] 4× 24" bar clamps
- [ ] Wood glue (2 quarts)
- [ ] Measuring tools (combo square, speed square)
- [ ] Safety equipment
- [ ] Finishing supplies

**REMOVED from original list:**
- [✗] Table saw blade (no table saw)
- [✗] Table saw accessories (no table saw)

**Materials to purchase:** (See WS4 for complete cut list)
- [ ] ¾" cabinet-grade plywood (3-4 sheets for cabinet boxes)
- [ ] ½" plywood (1 sheet for drawer boxes)
- [ ] ¼" plywood for backs and drawer bottoms (1 sheet)
- [ ] 2×4 lumber for toe kick platform
- [ ] 1×4 and 1×6 lumber for X-frame trim and barn door (~40 linear feet)
- [ ] Drawer slide hardware (3 pairs, 14" soft-close)
- [ ] Barn door hardware kit (72" track with soft-close)
- [ ] Edge banding (if needed)
- [ ] Cabinet hardware (hinges, handles, knobs)

**Timeline:** 1-2 days (shopping and delivery)

---

## Phase 1: Preparation and Practice (Weekend 1, Day 1)

### Step 1: Workshop Setup (2 hours)

**Create assembly area:**
- [ ] Clear level workspace minimum 4' × 8'
- [ ] Set up miter saw with support (you already have)
- [ ] Set up router (you already have)
- [ ] Prepare circular saw with new 60-tooth plywood blade
- [ ] Build or prepare DIY straightedge guide for circular saw
- [ ] Arrange tools within arm's reach
- [ ] Set up dust collection or shop vac

**Test tool accuracy:**
- [ ] Verify miter saw for 90° accuracy (critical for crosscuts)
- [ ] Test circular saw with straightedge guide (practice cut on scrap)
- [ ] Calibrate combination square and speed square
- [ ] Test level on known level surface

**UPDATED: No table saw setup required**

**Critical: Do not skip testing tools**
- 1° out of square = ⅛" error over 12" = ruined cabinet boxes

---

### Step 2: Pocket Hole Jig Practice (1 hour)

**Learn the jig on scrap:**
- [ ] Read Kreg K5 instructions completely
- [ ] Set jig for ¾" material thickness (cabinet boxes)
- [ ] Drill 10 practice pocket holes on scrap plywood
- [ ] Drive 10 practice pocket screws
- [ ] Join two scrap pieces, verify technique

**Also practice for ½" material (drawers):**
- [ ] Adjust jig to ½" setting
- [ ] Drill practice holes in ½" scrap
- [ ] Drive screws (use ½" or ⅝" screws, NOT 1¼")
- [ ] Verify technique

**What to learn:**
- Proper clamping technique
- Drill bit depth setting
- Screw driving torque (don't overdrive)
- How to align parts during joining

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Screw head not flush = adjust jig depth
- Plywood cracking = overdriven screw, reduce torque
- Holes misaligned = re-check jig setup

---

### Step 3: Dado Practice (1 hour - if using dados for bottom shelves)

**Router setup:**
- [ ] Install ¾" straight bit in router
- [ ] Set depth to 3/8"
- [ ] Create straightedge guide (scrap plywood + clamp)
- [ ] Practice cutting dados on scrap pieces
- [ ] Verify ¾" plywood fits snugly in dado

**Test accuracy:**
- Cut multiple dados at same setting
- Verify consistent depth and width
- Adjust if needed before cutting actual parts

**Skip this step if:** Not using dados, pocket holes only

---

## Phase 2: Cutting All Parts (Weekend 1, Day 2)

### Step 4: Big Box Store Rip Cuts (Part 1 of cutting - 30 min at store)

**NEW APPROACH: Leverage store cutting service**

**What to have store cut:**

**Sheet 1-2: Cabinet sides, tops, bottoms**
- [ ] Rip to 14" width (cabinet depth) - Full 96" length strips
- [ ] Ask for 6 strips at 14" × 96" (provides material for 6 sides + tops/bottoms)

**Sheet 3: Living room panel and barn door**
- [ ] Crosscut sheet to ~36" × 96" strip (rough size for panel)
- [ ] Separate piece ~32" × 96" for barn door

**Sheet 4 (½" for drawer boxes):**
- [ ] Rip to 10" width strips (drawer height)
- [ ] 3 strips at 10" × 96"

**Sheet 5 (¼" for backs and drawer bottoms):**
- [ ] Can cut later OR have store cut to approximate sizes

**Store cutting cost: ~$7 total**

**See ADDENDUM-no-table-saw.md for detailed store cutting strategy**

**After store cuts:**
- [ ] Verify measurements before leaving store
- [ ] Check for tearout or damage
- [ ] Request re-cut if off by more than 1/16"

---

### Step 5: Final Crosscuts and Precision Cuts (3-4 hours at home)

**Safety first:**
- [ ] Wear safety glasses
- [ ] Wear hearing protection
- [ ] Wear dust mask
- [ ] Have helper or support ready

**Miter saw crosscuts (easiest method):**

**Cabinet sides (6 pieces from 14" × 96" strips):**
- [ ] Set up stop block at 34.5" length
- [ ] Crosscut six pieces at 14" × 34.5"
- [ ] All identical due to stop block

**Cabinet tops (3 pieces):**
- [ ] Measure actual cabinet width after sides cut
- [ ] Typically 29.25" for 30" cabinet, 31.25" for 32" cabinet
- [ ] Crosscut from 14" strips to required widths

**Cabinet bottoms (3 pieces):**
- [ ] Same dimensions as tops
- [ ] Cut from remaining 14" strips

**Drawer parts (from ½" × 10" strips):**
- [ ] Fronts and backs: 6 pieces at 29½" × 10"
- [ ] Sides: 6 pieces at 13" × 10"
- [ ] See drawer-construction.md for details

**2×4 toe kick pieces (miter saw):**
- [ ] Two at 92" length (front and back)
- [ ] Multiple at 11" (cross supports, ~6 pieces)

**Circular saw + straightedge for large panels:**

**Living room panel (92" × 34.5"):**
- [ ] From store-cut ~36" × 96" piece
- [ ] Mark final dimensions on good face
- [ ] Score cut lines with utility knife (prevents tearout)
- [ ] Place GOOD FACE DOWN (circular saw tearout on top)
- [ ] Clamp straightedge guide
- [ ] Cut to 92" length
- [ ] Cut to 34.5" height
- [ ] This is critical visible piece - take time for accuracy

**Barn door panel (30" × 35"):**
- [ ] From store-cut ~32" × 96" piece
- [ ] Same technique as living room panel
- [ ] Cut to 30" × 35"
- [ ] Good face down
- [ ] See barn-door-guide.md for details

**After cutting:**
- [ ] Label each piece with its location (painter's tape + pencil)
- [ ] Mark good face and interior face
- [ ] Stack by cabinet (all Cabinet 1 parts together)
- [ ] Organize in assembly area
- [ ] Save offcuts for testing dados, pocket holes, finish

---

### Step 6: Drill All Pocket Holes (2-3 hours)

**Setup for batch drilling:**
- [ ] Set up Kreg jig in stable location
- [ ] Set for ¾" material (cabinet boxes first)
- [ ] Gather all cabinet box parts
- [ ] Have drill bits, jig, and parts within reach

**Drilling sequence (drill holes on interior faces only):**

**Cabinet sides (6 pieces total):**
- [ ] Mark top edge of each side piece
- [ ] Drill 3 pocket holes along top edge (for attaching top)
- [ ] Drill 3 pocket holes along bottom edge (for attaching bottom) - SKIP if using dados for bottom
- [ ] Keep holes on interior face (will be inside cabinet)

**Cabinet tops (3 pieces):**
- [ ] No pocket holes needed on tops (screws come from sides)

**Cabinet bottoms (3 pieces):**
- [ ] No pocket holes needed on bottoms if using dados
- [ ] If NOT using dados, same as tops (no holes, screws come from sides)

**Dividers (if any):**
- [ ] Drill pocket holes on ends that attach to sides

**Drawer box parts (adjust jig to ½" material):**
- [ ] See drawer-construction.md Phase 3 for drawer pocket holes
- [ ] Set jig for ½" thickness
- [ ] Use ½" or ⅝" pocket screws

**Quality check:**
- All holes on correct faces (interior only)?
- Holes proper depth (screw head flush when driven)?
- No cracks or tearout around holes?

---

### Step 7: Cut Dados (1 hour - if using)

**Only for bottom shelf dados (optional but recommended):**

**Dado specifications:**
- Width: ¾" (matches plywood thickness)
- Depth: 3/8"
- Location: 4" up from bottom (allows for toe kick)

**Router method:**
1. Set up router with ¾" straight bit at 3/8" depth
2. Clamp straightedge guide to cabinet side piece
3. Position guide 4" from bottom edge
4. Route dado (go slow, multiple passes if needed)
5. Test fit bottom shelf in dado
6. Repeat for all 6 side pieces

**Also cut dados for drawer bottoms (if using dado method):**
- See drawer-construction.md Phase 2
- ¼" dado, ¼" deep, ¼" from bottom edge

**Verify:**
- Dado depth consistent on all pieces?
- Bottom shelf/drawer bottom sits flush when inserted?
- No tearout on face veneer?

**Skip this step if:** Pocket holes only, no dados

---

### Step 8: Sand All Interior Surfaces (2 hours)

**Why sand now, not later:**
- Can't reach interiors after assembly
- Much easier on flat pieces
- Finish quality depends on prep work

**Sanding sequence:**
- [ ] Start with 120 grit (remove mill marks, smooth any rough spots)
- [ ] Progress to 150 grit (refine surface)
- [ ] Finish with 220 grit (final smooth for paint)

**Sand these parts now:**
- Interior faces of all cabinet side pieces
- Interior faces of tops and bottoms
- All edges that will be inside cabinet
- Drawer box parts (interior faces)

**Do NOT sand yet:**
- Exterior faces (wait until after assembly)
- Living room panel (separate process with X-frame)
- Barn door (separate process)
- Face frames (if making - separate process)

**After sanding:**
- [ ] Vacuum all surfaces
- [ ] Wipe with tack cloth
- [ ] Keep dust-free until assembly

## Phase 3: Toe Kick Platform Construction (Weekend 2, Day 1 - Morning)

### Step 9: Build Toe Kick Platform Base (3 hours)

**Purpose:** Creates level base for cabinet boxes, brings total height to 40"

**Platform specifications:**
- **Height:** 4" (total height with cabinet box: 34.5" + 4" + 1.5" countertop = 40")
- **Length:** 92" (full bar length)
- **Depth:** 14" (matches cabinet depth)

**Materials:**
- 2×4 lumber for frame
- ¾" plywood for top (can use scraps from cabinet cutting)
- Construction screws (2½")

**Construction sequence:**

   - [ ] Lay out frame on floor
   - [ ] Join with pocket holes OR construction screws (toenailed)
   - [ ] Check for square (measure diagonals)

2. **Attach plywood top:**
   - [ ] Cut ¾" plywood to 14" × 92" (use circular saw + guide OR store cut)
   - [ ] Attach to 2×4 frame with construction screws every 8"
   - [ ] Countersink screw heads slightly below surface

3. **Notch for column (if needed):**
   - [ ] Measure column location precisely
   - [ ] Mark notch on platform
   - [ ] Cut notch with jigsaw or circular saw
   - [ ] Test fit around column

4. **Verify level:**
   - [ ] Place platform in final location
   - [ ] Use 4' level to check front-to-back and side-to-side
   - [ ] Shim under low spots (critical: must be perfectly level)
   - [ ] Once level, mark shim locations for reinstallation

**Toe kick design: Simple recessed (recommended)**
- Set platform back 3" from front edge
- Creates shadow line
- No additional trim needed

- [ ] Position platform where bar will sit
- [ ] Check level (critical)
- [ ] Shim as needed
- [ ] Verify level again (must be perfect)
- [ ] Secure to floor (construction screws into floor joists if wood, or tapcon anchors if concrete)

**Note column constraint:**
- Platform must fit around existing column
- Verify notch fits properly

---

### Step 21: Set Cabinet Boxes on Platform (1 hour)

**Placement sequence:**
- [ ] Start with cabinet furthest from column
- [ ] Set on toe kick platform
- [ ] Check level (front-to-back and side-to-side)
- [ ] Shim if needed under cabinet
- [ ] Position next cabinet
- [ ] Clamp cabinets together temporarily
- [ ] Verify all three cabinets level and aligned

**Check alignment:**
- Front edges flush?
- Top edges flush?
- Gaps between cabinets minimal?

---

### Step 22: Secure Cabinets Together and to Wall (1 hour)

**Join cabinets to each other:**
- [ ] Clamp adjacent cabinets together (sides touching)
- [ ] Drill pilot holes through side of one cabinet into next
- [ ] Drive wood screws to join (2-3 screws per joint)
- [ ] Remove clamps

**Secure to wall (kitchen side):**
- [ ] Locate wall studs (use stud finder)
- [ ] Drill pilot holes through cabinet back into studs
- [ ] Drive 3" wood screws through back into studs
- [ ] At least 2 screws per cabinet into studs
- [ ] Verify cabinets still level after securing

**Note: Living room side will have decorative panel, so wall attachment from kitchen side only**

---

### Step 23: Install Living Room Panel with X-Frame (1 hour)

**This is the "front" everyone sees from living room:**

**Attachment:**
- [ ] Position panel against back of cabinet boxes
- [ ] Panel should be finished on living room side (already painted with X-frame)
- [ ] Verify panel is plumb and flush with cabinet top
- [ ] Attach to cabinet boxes with glue + brad nails from interior
- [ ] OR use figure-8 fasteners (hidden, allows expansion)

**Alignment critical:**
- Panel is focal point
- Any gaps or misalignment immediately visible
- Take time to get perfect

**Seal edges:**
- Small bead of caulk at top edge (where panel meets future countertop)
- Caulk at floor (where panel meets floor)
- Touch up paint if needed

---

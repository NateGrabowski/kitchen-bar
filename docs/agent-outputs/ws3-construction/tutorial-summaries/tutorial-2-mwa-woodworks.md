**Tutorial Type:** Professional-grade cabinet construction for kitchens and pantries
**Date Accessed:** 2026-01-09

## Overview

MWA Woodworks provides a comprehensive tutorial on building high-quality DIY cabinets that rivals professional cabinetry. This tutorial bridges the gap between basic DIY methods and professional cabinet shop techniques, making it ideal for intermediate to advanced woodworkers who want exceptional results.

## Key Construction Philosophy

**Professional Results with DIY Methods** - The tutorial emphasizes:
- Using cabinet-grade materials throughout
- Proper joinery techniques for longevity
- Attention to detail in assembly
- Professional-grade hardware
- Both face frame and frameless options

## Materials Specification

### Cabinet Box Materials
- **¾" Hardwood Plywood** (Birch, Maple, or Oak veneer)
  - Use for all structural components (sides, top, bottom, shelves)
  - Choose plywood over solid wood for dimensional stability
  - Hardwood veneer offers superior finish quality

- **¼" Plywood** - For cabinet backs
  - Helps square the cabinet
  - Can use lower grade if it won't be visible

### Face Frame Materials (if using)
- **Solid hardwood** (Poplar for paint, Oak/Maple for stain)
- **1×2" for rails and stiles**
- **1×3" or wider for top rails** (provides room for crown molding attachment)

### Hardware and Fasteners
- **Pocket hole screws** (1¼" and 2½")
- **Wood glue** (Titebond II or III)
- **Soft-close hinges** (European cup hinges for frameless, traditional for face frame)
- **Drawer slides** (Full extension, soft-close recommended)
- **Adjustable shelf pins**

## Tools Required

### Must Have Power Tools
- **Table saw** - Primary tool for ripping and crosscutting
  - Needs accurate fence for repeatable cuts
  - Dado blade set recommended for advanced joinery
- **Miter saw** - For crosscuts and face frame work
- **Router** - For edge profiles and dado cuts
  - ¼" or ½" collet router
  - Router table highly recommended
- **Drill/driver** - For pocket holes and assembly
- **Pocket hole jig** - Kreg K5 or similar

### Recommended Power Tools
- **Brad nailer** - For backs and trim
- **Random orbit sander** - For finish prep
- **Track saw or panel saw** - For breaking down sheet goods

### Essential Hand Tools
- Measuring tape (25 ft)
- Combination square
- Speed square
- Clamps (minimum 4-6 bar clamps, 24" or longer)
- Level
- Chisels (for hinge mortises if doing inset doors)

## Skill Level

**Intermediate to Advanced** - This tutorial assumes:
- Comfort with all power tools listed
- Understanding of wood movement and grain direction
- Ability to read and create cut lists
- Patience for precision work
- Problem-solving skills when things don't go perfectly

## Key Techniques Taught

### 1. Material Selection and Preparation
- **Plywood vs. Hardwood Decision Matrix**
  - Plywood: Stable, won't warp, ideal for cabinet bodies
  - Hardwood: Natural grain beauty, best for visible face frames and doors

- **Wood Acclimation**
  - Let materials sit in shop for 48 hours minimum
  - Prevents warping after assembly due to moisture changes

### 2. Cutting Plywood Accurately
- **Breaking Down Full Sheets**
  - Cut to rough size first for easier handling
  - Use table saw with outfeed support or track saw
  - Make final precision cuts on table saw

- **Preventing Tearout**
  - Use sharp blades (60-80 tooth for plywood)
  - Score cut line with utility knife
  - Place good face up for table saw, down for circular saw
  - Use zero-clearance inserts

### 3. Cabinet Box Joinery Options

**Option A: Pocket Hole Method** (Recommended for DIY)
- Drill pocket holes on cabinet sides
- Assemble with glue and screws
- Fast, strong, and forgiving
- Holes hidden inside cabinet

**Option B: Dado Joints** (Strongest)
- Cut ¼" or ⅜" deep dados in cabinet sides
- Shelves and bottom sit in dados
- Provides alignment and exceptional strength
- Requires dado blade or router

**Option C: Dowels or Biscuits**
- More time-consuming
- Requires specialized tools (dowel jig or biscuit joiner)
- Professional appearance
- Less forgiving than pocket holes

### 4. Face Frame Construction

**Joinery for Face Frames:**
- **Pocket holes** - Fastest, strong, hidden from front
- **Mortise and tenon** - Traditional, strongest, time-intensive
- **Dowels** - Clean appearance, moderate strength

**Assembly Process:**
- Build frames flat on workbench
- Check for square by measuring diagonals
- Attach to cabinet box with glue and brad nails or pocket screws from inside

### 5. Cabinet Assembly Sequence

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Cut all parts to size from cut list
2. Drill pocket holes (or cut dados)
3. Sand all interior surfaces (before assembly)
4. Dry fit components to verify fit
5. Apply glue to joints
6. Assemble cabinet box
7. Install back to square cabinet
8. Attach face frame (if using)
9. Install adjustable shelf pins
10. Final sanding of exterior

### 6. Quality Control Checkpoints

**During assembly:**
- Check square after every component added (measure diagonals)
- Ensure cabinet box is flat (no twist)
- Verify all pocket holes are properly seated
- Clean up glue squeeze-out immediately with damp cloth

**Before finishing:**
- Sand all surfaces starting with 120 grit, ending with 220 grit
- Fill any voids or defects with wood filler
- Wipe down with tack cloth

## Main Takeaways for Our Project

### Direct Applications

1. **Plywood stability is critical for shallow cabinets**
   - At only 14" deep, any warping would be immediately visible
   - Plywood's cross-grain construction prevents this

2. **Face frames add traditional character**
   - Aligns with modern farmhouse aesthetic
   - Provides mounting surface for Shaker doors
   - Creates visual "weight" on kitchen side

3. **Professional hardware elevates the project**
   - Soft-close hinges prevent slamming
   - Full-extension slides maximize usability in shallow cabinets
   - Quality hardware extends cabinet lifespan

### Adaptations Needed for Kitchen Bar

**Height considerations:**
- Standard base cabinets: 34.5" height
- Our spec: 34.5" cabinet height (perfect match)
- Toe kick: 4" (we can customize this during platform build)

**Depth considerations:**
- Tutorial assumes 24" standard depth
- We need 14" depth
- Cut plywood parts 10" narrower than standard dimensions
- Shelf spans will be shorter = less sagging risk

**Living room visibility:**
- Tutorial focuses on kitchen-facing aesthetics
- Our back panel faces living room (primary viewing angle)
- Need premium finish on back panel
- Consider this the "front" for finishing purposes

### Build Quality Hierarchy

MWA emphasizes three quality levels:

**Good** (Budget DIY)
- Pocket hole construction
- Paint-grade plywood
- Basic hardware
- Cost: ~$500

**Better** (Quality DIY)
- Pocket holes + dado for bottom shelf
- Cabinet-grade hardwood plywood
- Soft-close hardware
- Cost: ~$800

**Best** (Professional)
- All dado construction
- Premium hardwood plywood
- European hardware
- Custom doors
- Cost: ~$1200

**Recommendation for our project: "Better" tier** - Balances quality and effort

## Specific Technique Recommendations

### For Our 14" Depth Cabinets

1. **Use pocket holes for box construction**
   - Faster than dados
   - Strong enough for shallow cabinets
   - Easier to get square

2. **Add face frames on kitchen side**
   - 1×2" rails and stiles
   - Painted to match Shaker doors
   - Creates traditional farmhouse look

3. **Finish living room side as premium panel**
   - No face frame on back (modern clean look)
   - High-quality veneer facing living room
   - Consider it the "show face"

4. **Use dado for bottom shelf only**
   - Adds strength where weight rests
   - Helps with alignment during assembly
   - Worth the extra step

## Professional Tips from Tutorial

### Workshop Setup
- Create a dedicated assembly area with level surface
- Have all tools within arm's reach
- Pre-cut all components before starting assembly
- Organize parts by cabinet for batch assembly

### Time Management
- First cabinet takes 4-6 hours
- Subsequent cabinets take 2-3 hours
- For our three-cabinet bar: Budget 10-12 hours total

### Cost Control
- Buy plywood in full sheets (cheaper per sq ft)
- Purchase hardware in bulk (saves 20-30%)
- Make doors yourself (saves $50-100 per door)

## Limitations of Tutorial

**What's not covered:**
- Specific door building techniques (separate tutorial needed)
- Finishing and painting methods
- Installation to wall/floor
- Countertop attachment details
- Electrical integration (outlets, lighting)

**Areas requiring additional research:**
- Shaker door construction
- Paint vs. stain finishing
- Living room panel design options
- Toe kick platform building

## Comparison to Woodshop Diaries Tutorial

**MWA Woodworks is more advanced:**

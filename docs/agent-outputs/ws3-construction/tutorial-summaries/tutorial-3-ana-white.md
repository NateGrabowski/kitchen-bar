**Date Accessed:** 2026-01-09

## Overview

Ana White has been sharing free woodworking plans since 2009 from her home in Alaska. Her cabinet building resources are specifically designed for absolute beginners who want professional results without professional skills or tools. The standout feature is a **free custom design app** that generates cut lists based on your specific dimensions.

## Key Philosophy

**"If you can't find nice furniture, build it yourself"**

Ana's approach emphasizes:
- Accessibility for all skill levels
- Minimal tool requirements
- Cost savings (DIY vs. buying)
- Detailed step-by-step plans
- Community support through forums

## Free Design App - Game Changer

### What It Does
Input your desired cabinet dimensions and the app generates:
- Complete cut list for all plywood parts
- Hardware requirements
- Assembly diagrams
- Material costs estimate

### Why This Matters for Our Project
- **Custom 14" depth** - App adjusts for non-standard depths
- **92" length planning** - Calculate optimal cabinet configuration
- **Exact material lists** - No waste from over-buying
- **Visual preview** - See design before cutting wood

### How to Access
Visit ana-white.com and navigate to "Frameless Kitchen Cabinet Building Guide" for the design app

## Materials Used in Ana White Plans

### Plywood
- **¾" Hardwood Plywood** - For cabinet boxes
  - Birch or oak veneer recommended
  - One sheet makes approximately 2 cabinet boxes

- **¼" Plywood** - For cabinet backs

### Lumber
- **1×2 Pine or Poplar** - For face frame rails and stiles (if adding face frames)
- **1×6 Pine or Poplar** - For top face frame rail (provides crown molding nailer)

### Hardware
- **Pocket hole screws** (1¼" and 2½")
- **Wood glue** (standard carpenter's glue)
- **Concealed hinges** (European cup style)
- **Drawer slides** (basic to soft-close depending on budget)
- **Brad nails** (for backs)

## Tools Required

### Power Tools (Minimal List)
- **Circular saw** - Can build entire cabinet with just this
  - Use with straight edge guide
  - Budget option: $50-100
- **Drill/driver** - For pocket holes and assembly
- **Pocket hole jig** - Kreg Mini or R3 ($20-40)

### Optional But Helpful
- **Miter saw** - Makes crosscuts easier
- **Table saw** - For more accurate rip cuts
- **Brad nailer** - Faster back installation

### Hand Tools
- Measuring tape
- Square (speed square and combination square)
- Level
- Clamps (at least 4)
- Pencil (keep it sharp!)

## Skill Level

**Beginner to Intermediate** - Specifically designed for:
- First-time cabinet builders
- DIYers with basic tool knowledge
- Those with limited workshop space
- Budget-conscious homeowners

**You can succeed if you can:**
- Measure accurately
- Make straight cuts with a circular saw
- Use a drill
- Follow written instructions

## Key Techniques Taught

### 1. Frameless Cabinet Construction

**Benefits of frameless:**
- No face frame to build (saves time and materials)
- Maximizes interior cabinet space (important for our 14" depth)
- Modern, European-style appearance
- Simpler joinery

**Construction method:**
- Pocket hole joinery throughout
- Full overlay doors cover plywood edges
- Clean, contemporary look

### 2. Pocket Hole Joinery - Ana's Core Method

**Why Ana recommends pocket holes:**
- "Cheapest, easiest, and fastest way to do joints"
- No complex tools or setups required
- Strong when combined with glue
- Hidden from view when done correctly

**Ana's pocket hole tips:**
- **Always predrill holes** before attaching screws
- **Use glue** with all pocket screw joints for maximum strength
- **Clamp before screwing** - keeps joints tight and flush
- **Hide pocket holes** on interior or hidden faces

### 3. Measuring and Squaring - Critical Success Factor

**Ana's measurement rules:**
- Use a **speed square** after each assembly step
- **Measure diagonals** to check for square (diagonals should be equal)
- **Sharp pencil** - Dull pencils add uncertainty to measurements
- **Measure twice, cut once** (oldest rule, still the most important)

### 4. Budget Cabinet Options

Ana provides three cost tiers:

**DIY Everything** - $1200-1800
- Build cabinet boxes
- Build doors from scratch
- Apply all finishes yourself
- Maximum time, maximum savings

**Hybrid Approach** - $2500 (Ana's recommendation)
- Build cabinet boxes yourself (boxes are easy)
- Outsource doors to cabinet shop (doors are tedious)
- You finish and install
- Saves time on most tedious part

**Our kitchen bar application:**
- $500-800 for three cabinet boxes (materials only)
- $200-400 for doors (if purchased)
- Total: $700-1200 for hybrid approach

### 5. Cabinet Sizing Flexibility

**Standard dimensions Ana works with:**
- **Wall cabinets:** 30" height (can adjust taller or shorter)
- **Base cabinets:** 34.5" height (perfect for our project)
- **Depth:** Any depth from 11" to 24" (app adjusts)
- **Width:** Up to 36" per cabinet box

**For our 92" bar:**
- Option 1: Three 30" wide cabinets (90" total, trim ends)
- Option 2: Two 36" + one 18" cabinet (90" total)
- Option 3: Use design app to calculate exact configuration

### 6. Assembly Tips for Success

**Before assembly:**
- Cut all pieces first (batch cutting saves time)
- Label each piece with its location
- Organize by cabinet if building multiple
- Dry fit before gluing (catch errors early)

**During assembly:**
- Work on flat, level surface
- Apply glue to all joints (don't rely on screws alone)
- Check for square after each piece added
- Clean glue squeeze-out immediately with damp cloth

**After assembly:**
- Let glue cure overnight before moving cabinet
- Install back to finalize squareness
- Sand all surfaces before finishing

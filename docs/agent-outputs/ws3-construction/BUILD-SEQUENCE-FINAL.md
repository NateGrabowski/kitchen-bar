# BUILD SEQUENCE FINAL - Kitchen Bar Cabinet

**The Definitive Build Guide with Ruthless Optimization**

**Project:** Split-Level Kitchen Bar Cabinet (92" L x 40" H x 14"/30" D)
**Builder Profile:** Intermediate DIYer, no table saw
**Optimized Time:** 35-40 hours over 3-4 weekends (down from 45-50 hours)

---

## Critical Insight: The Three Phases

This build has three distinct phases with different priorities:

| Phase | Focus | Hours | Key Insight |
|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| **FABRICATION** | Cutting, drilling, prep | 12-14h | Batch everything. Tool changes kill time. |
| **ASSEMBLY** | Building cabinet boxes | 10-12h | Square is life. Check constantly. |
| **INTEGRATION** | Hardware, finish, install | 13-14h | Sequence matters. Drying time is free work time. |

---

## The Golden Rules

Before starting, internalize these principles:

### 1. Batch Relentlessly
Do ALL cuts of one type before switching tools. Do ALL pocket holes in one session. Do ALL sanding before ANY finishing. Changing tools and setups wastes 10-15 minutes each time.

### 2. Pre-Finish Interior Surfaces
Paint the inside faces of panels BEFORE assembly. You cannot spray or properly brush the interior of an assembled cabinet. Mask glue joints with painter's tape.

### 3. Parallel Work During Cure Times
While glue cures (minimum 30 min), paint dries (2-4 hours between coats), or finish cures (24-48 hours), do something else. Every drying period is an opportunity.

### 4. Measure Twice, Verify Three Times
Before cutting: double-check measurement. Before drilling: verify orientation. Before assembling: dry-fit first. Mistakes compound.

### 5. Square Is Everything
A 1/16" error at the box level becomes 1/4" at the countertop level. Check diagonals obsessively.

## Weekend 1: Fabrication Blitz (8-10 hours)

### Day 1 Morning: Precision Cutting (4 hours)

**CRITICAL: Set up straight-edge cutting guide ONCE. Don't move it between cuts of same width.**

#### Cutting Sequence (Optimized Order)

**Step 1: All 14" depth cuts (cabinet panels)**
- Cabinet bottom: 14" x 92"
- Cabinet top: 14" x 92"
- Interior dividers: 14" x 34.5" (x3)
- Shelves: 14" x 28.75" (x2)

**Step 2: All 30" depth cuts (counter overhang)**
- Counter support panels: 30" x appropriate lengths

**Step 3: All 4" height cuts (toe kick)**
- Front piece: 4" x 92"
- Returns: 4" x depth

**Step 4: All door/panel cuts (living room side)**
- Living room backing panel: 34.5" x 92"
- Barn door panel: 30" x 35"
- Double door panels: TBD based on final opening

**Step 5: Drawer box parts from 1/2" ripped strips**
- Fronts/backs: 29.5" (x6)
- Sides: 13" (x6)
- Label each piece: D1-F, D1-B, D1-S, etc.

#### Quality Gate 1: Dimension Verification
**STOP and verify before proceeding:**
- [ ] All critical pieces within 1/16" of spec?
- [ ] Cabinet bottom/top exactly same length?
- [ ] All dividers exactly same height?
- [ ] Drawer parts match each other?

### Day 1 Afternoon: Pocket Hole Marathon (2-3 hours)

**Set up pocket hole jig ONCE. Do not adjust between pieces of same thickness.**

#### Pocket Hole Sequence (3/4" Material First, Then 1/2")

**3/4" Material Settings:**
- Jig: 3/4" position
- Collar: Between 1/2" and 3/4" mark (prevents blowout on plywood)
- Screws: 1-1/4" coarse thread

**Hole Locations:**

**Cabinet Bottom (edge holes facing up):**
- Front edge: 5 holes evenly spaced
- Back edge: 5 holes evenly spaced
- At each divider location: 3 holes

**Cabinet Top (edge holes facing down):**
- Same pattern as bottom

**Dividers (edge holes on both ends):**
- Top edge: 3 holes
- Bottom edge: 3 holes
- Each shelf location: 2 holes

**Toe Kick Pieces:**
- Ends: 2 holes each

**Switch to 1/2" Material Settings:**
- Jig: 1/2" position
- Collar: Just above 1/2" mark
- Screws: 3/4" or 1" fine thread

**Drawer Box Parts:**
- Fronts: 3 holes each side edge (6 total per piece)
- Backs: 3 holes each side edge (6 total per piece)
- Sides: 3 holes along bottom edge IF not using dado for bottom

#### Quality Gate 2: Pocket Hole Verification
- [ ] All holes drilled to correct depth (not poking through)?
- [ ] Holes on correct faces (will be hidden after assembly)?
- [ ] All plywood edges intact (no blowout)?

### Day 1 Evening: Surface Preparation (1-2 hours)

**Batch sand ALL pieces before finishing begins.**

**Sanding Sequence:**
1. 120 grit: Remove mill marks, rough spots
2. 150 grit: Smooth all surfaces
3. 220 grit: Final smooth (visible surfaces only)

**Critical Areas:**
- All visible plywood faces
- All edges that will be visible
- Ease all sharp edges (one pass with 150 grit block)

**DO NOT SAND:**
- Glue joint surfaces (bare wood bonds better)
- Inside of drawer boxes (hidden)
- Back of cabinet (against wall)

---

## Weekend 1 Continued: Pre-Finishing

### Day 2 Morning: Prime Interior Surfaces (1-2 hours)

**Pre-Finish Strategy:**
Prime and paint the INSIDE faces of panels BEFORE assembly. After assembly, you cannot properly finish cabinet interiors.

**Surfaces to Pre-Finish:**
- Cabinet bottom: TOP surface (will be inside cabinet)
- Cabinet top: BOTTOM surface (will be inside cabinet)
- Dividers: BOTH sides
- Living room panel: BACK side (faces inside cabinet)

**Masking Required:**
- Use painter's tape on ALL edges where glue joints will be made
- Pocket hole areas: mask 1" around each hole

**Apply Primer:**
- Use shellac-based primer (Zinsser BIN) or quality latex primer
- One coat sufficient for interior
- Let dry 1-2 hours

**PARALLEL WORK: While primer dries, begin electrical prep work**

---

## Electrical Integration Point 1

**During drying time, complete these electrical preparations:**

### Wire Routing Prep (Per WS7 Plan)
1. Mark wire pathway holes on dividers (use template)
2. Mark grommet locations for cord pass-through
3. Mark USB outlet rough-in location
4. Drill all electrical pathway holes NOW before assembly

**Hole Specifications:**
- Wire pathways: 1-1/4" diameter holes
- Grommet locations: Per grommet size (typically 2" or 2-1/2")
- Route holes: 3" from back edge of dividers

### Quality Gate 3: Electrical Prep Verification
- [ ] All wire pathway holes drilled?
- [ ] Holes deburred (smooth edges)?
- [ ] Grommet holes match grommet size?
- [ ] Holes won't interfere with shelf placement?

---

## Weekend 2: Cabinet Box Assembly (6-8 hours)

### Day 3 Morning: Main Box Assembly (3-4 hours)

**Assembly Order Matters:** Build from bottom up, verify square at EVERY step.

#### Step 1: Build Toe Kick Platform (45 min)

**Why Build Separately:**
- Easier to level a small platform than entire cabinet
- Allows leveling before heavy cabinet goes on top
- Industry standard for kitchen cabinets

**Assembly:**
1. Lay toe kick front (92" x 4") face down
2. Attach end pieces with pocket screws
3. Add interior supports every 24"
4. Verify rectangle is square (diagonals equal)
5. Set aside - will level and install later

#### Step 2: Install Dividers to Bottom (1 hour)

**Reference Points:**
- Drawer section: 0-30" from left
- Barn door section: 30-60" from left
- Double door section: 60-92" from right

**Assembly:**
1. Mark divider positions on cabinet bottom
2. Apply glue to bottom edge of first divider
3. Position divider on marks
4. Drive pocket screws from bottom up into divider
5. Check divider is plumb (use 4' level)
6. Clamp if needed while screws set
7. Repeat for remaining dividers

**CRITICAL: Measure diagonal from top of each divider to opposite bottom corner. Both measurements must be equal.**

#### Step 3: Attach Cabinet Top (1 hour)

1. Apply glue to top edges of all dividers
2. Position top panel (pocket holes facing down)
3. Align top with bottom edges (flush all around)
4. Drive pocket screws from top through into dividers
5. Check for square again

#### Step 4: Add Shelves (30 min)

1. Mark shelf positions on dividers
2. Install shelf pins OR use pocket screws from sides
3. For fixed shelves: glue and screw
4. For adjustable: install shelf pins only

### Day 3 Afternoon: Living Room Panel (1-2 hours)

#### Install Backing Panel

**The living room panel serves three purposes:**
1. Visual facade (what living room sees)
2. Structural backing for barn door track
3. Electrical wire concealment

**Installation:**
1. Cabinet box should be lying on its back (kitchen side down)
2. Apply glue around all edges
3. Position living room panel flush with cabinet edges
4. Brad nail every 6" around perimeter
5. Brad nail into each divider

**IMPORTANT:** Leave access if electrical work not complete.

### Day 3: Quality Gate 4: Box Square Verification

**STOP EVERYTHING. This is the most critical checkpoint.**

- [ ] Overall cabinet dimensions: 92" L x 34.5" H x 14" D (within 1/8")?
- [ ] All four corners square (use framing square)?
- [ ] Diagonals equal (within 1/4")?
- [ ] All dividers plumb?
- [ ] Cabinet bottom flat (no twist)?
- [ ] Living room panel flush with edges?

**If anything is wrong, FIX IT NOW. Do not proceed with a crooked cabinet.**

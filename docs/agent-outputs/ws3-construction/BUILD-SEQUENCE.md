# Kitchen Bar Cabinet Build Sequence

**Project:** Kitchen Bar Cabinet Construction
**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Purpose:** Define step-by-step order of operations from start to finish

---

## Build Overview

**Total estimated time:** 3-4 weekends (20-30 hours)
**Cabinet count:** 3 base cabinets totaling 92" length
**Construction method:** Pocket hole joinery with optional dados
**Finish:** Paint (modern farmhouse white/cream)

---

## Pre-Build Phase (Week 1)

### Step 0: Tool and Material Acquisition

**Tools to purchase:** (See tool-list.md for details)
- [ ] Kreg K5 pocket hole jig
- [ ] Pocket hole screws (500 count)
- [ ] 60-tooth plywood blade
- [ ] 4× 24" bar clamps
- [ ] Wood glue (2 quarts)
- [ ] Measuring tools (combo square, speed square)
- [ ] Safety equipment
- [ ] Finishing supplies

**Materials to purchase:** (See WS4 for complete cut list)
- [ ] ¾" cabinet-grade birch plywood (3-4 sheets)
- [ ] ¼" plywood for backs (1 sheet)
- [ ] 2×4 lumber for toe kick platform
- [ ] Edge banding (if needed)
- [ ] Hardware (hinges, drawer slides)

**Timeline:** 1-2 days (shopping and delivery)

---

## Phase 1: Preparation and Practice (Weekend 1, Day 1)

### Step 1: Workshop Setup (2 hours)

**Create assembly area:**
- [ ] Clear level workspace minimum 4' × 8'
- [ ] Set up table saw with outfeed support
- [ ] Arrange tools within arm's reach
- [ ] Install 60-tooth plywood blade on table saw
- [ ] Set up dust collection or shop vac

**Test tool accuracy:**
- [ ] Verify table saw fence is square to blade
- [ ] Check miter saw for 90° accuracy
- [ ] Calibrate combination square and speed square
- [ ] Test level on known level surface

**Critical: Do not skip testing tools**
- 1° out of square = ⅛" error over 12" = ruined cabinet boxes

---

### Step 2: Pocket Hole Jig Practice (1 hour)

**Learn the jig on scrap:**
- [ ] Read Kreg K5 instructions completely
- [ ] Set jig for ¾" material thickness
- [ ] Drill 10 practice pocket holes on scrap plywood
- [ ] Drive 10 practice pocket screws
- [ ] Join two scrap pieces, verify technique

**What to learn:**
- Proper clamping technique
- Drill bit depth setting
- Screw driving torque (don't overdrive)
- How to align parts during joining

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Screw head not flush = adjust jig depth
- Plywood cracking = overdriven screw, reduce torque
- Holes misaligned = re-check jig setup

---

### Step 3: Dado Practice (1 hour - if using dados for bottom shelves)

**Router setup:**
- [ ] Install ¾" straight bit in router
- [ ] Set depth to 3/8"
- [ ] Create straightedge guide (scrap plywood + clamp)
- [ ] Practice cutting dados on scrap pieces
- [ ] Verify ¾" plywood fits snugly in dado

**Test accuracy:**
- Cut multiple dados at same setting
- Verify consistent depth and width
- Adjust if needed before cutting actual parts

**Skip this step if:** Not using dados, pocket holes only

---

## Phase 2: Cutting All Parts (Weekend 1, Day 2)

### Step 4: Break Down Plywood Sheets (3 hours)

**Safety first:**
- [ ] Wear safety glasses
- [ ] Wear hearing protection
- [ ] Wear dust mask
- [ ] Have helper or outfeed support ready

**Cutting sequence (cuts from largest to smallest):**

**Sheet 1 - Cabinet sides and tops:**
- [ ] Rip sheet to 14" width strips (cabinet depth)
- [ ] Crosscut sides to 34.5" height (6 pieces needed, 2 per cabinet)
- [ ] Crosscut tops to cabinet width minus ¾" (3 pieces)

**Sheet 2 - Cabinet bottoms and dividers:**
- [ ] Rip 14" width strips
- [ ] Crosscut bottoms to match tops (3 pieces)
- [ ] Crosscut any dividers if cabinets have them

**Sheet 3 - Living room facing panel:**
- [ ] Rip to 34.5" height
- [ ] Crosscut to 92" length (full bar length)

**Sheet 4 (¼") - Cabinet backs:**
- [ ] Measure cabinet box dimensions after assembly (do this later)

**Critical cutting tips:**
- Good face up when using table saw (blade exits bottom, less tearout on top)
- Score cut line with utility knife to prevent tearout
- Use push stick for last 12" of rip cuts
- Keep offcuts for testing dados, pocket holes, finish

**After cutting:**
- [ ] Label each piece with its location (painter's tape + pencil)
- [ ] Stack by cabinet (all Cabinet 1 parts together)
- [ ] Organize in assembly area

---

### Step 5: Drill All Pocket Holes (2 hours)

**Setup for batch drilling:**
- [ ] Set up Kreg jig in stable location
- [ ] Set for ¾" material
- [ ] Gather all cabinet box parts
- [ ] Have drill bits, jig, and parts within reach

**Drilling sequence (drill holes on interior faces only):**

**Cabinet sides (6 pieces total):**
- [ ] Mark top edge of each side piece
- [ ] Drill 3 pocket holes along top edge (for attaching top)
- [ ] Drill 3 pocket holes along bottom edge (for attaching bottom) - SKIP if using dados for bottom
- [ ] Keep holes on interior face (will be inside cabinet)

**Cabinet tops (3 pieces):**
- [ ] No pocket holes needed on tops (screws come from sides)

**Cabinet bottoms (3 pieces):**
- [ ] No pocket holes needed on bottoms if using dados
- [ ] If NOT using dados, same as tops (no holes, screws come from sides)

**Dividers (if any):**
- [ ] Drill pocket holes on ends that attach to sides

**Quality check:**
- All holes on correct faces (interior only)?
- Holes proper depth (screw head flush when driven)?
- No cracks or tearout around holes?

---

### Step 6: Cut Dados (1 hour - if using)

**Only for bottom shelf dados:**
- [ ] Mark dado location on all 6 side pieces
- [ ] Dado location: 4" up from bottom (allows for toe kick)
- [ ] Set up router with ¾" straight bit at 3/8" depth
- [ ] Clamp straightedge guide to side piece
- [ ] Cut dado (go slow, multiple passes if deep)
- [ ] Test fit bottom shelf in dado
- [ ] Repeat for all 6 side pieces (both sides of each cabinet)

**Verify:**
- Dado depth consistent on all pieces?
- Bottom shelf sits flush when inserted?
- No tearout on face veneer?

**Skip this step if:** Pocket holes only, no dados

---

### Step 7: Sand All Interior Surfaces (2 hours)

**Why sand now, not later:**
- Can't reach interiors after assembly
- Much easier on flat pieces
- Finish quality depends on prep work

**Sanding sequence:**
- [ ] Start with 120 grit (remove mill marks, smooth any rough spots)
- [ ] Progress to 150 grit (refine surface)
- [ ] Finish with 220 grit (final smooth for paint)

**Sand these parts now:**
- Interior faces of all side pieces
- Interior faces of tops and bottoms
- All edges that will be inside cabinet

**Do NOT sand yet:**
- Exterior faces (wait until after assembly)
- Living room panel (separate process)
- Face frames (if making - separate process)

**After sanding:**
- [ ] Vacuum all surfaces
- [ ] Wipe with tack cloth
- [ ] Keep dust-free until assembly

---

## Phase 3: Toe Kick Platform Construction (Weekend 2, Day 1 - Morning)

### Step 8: Build Toe Kick Platform Base (3 hours)

**Purpose:** Creates level base for cabinet boxes, brings total height to 40"

**Platform specifications:**
- **Height:** 4" (total height with cabinet box: 34.5" + 4" + 1.5" countertop = 40")
- **Length:** 92" (full bar length)
- **Depth:** 14" (matches cabinet depth)

**Materials:**
- 2×4 lumber for frame
- ¾" plywood for top
- Construction screws (2½")

**Construction sequence:**

1. **Build 2×4 frame:**
   - [ ] Cut 2×4s: Two at 92" length (front and back), multiple at 14" (cross supports every 16")
   - [ ] Lay out frame on floor
   - [ ] Join with pocket holes OR construction screws (toenailed)
   - [ ] Check for square (measure diagonals)

2. **Attach plywood top:**
   - [ ] Cut ¾" plywood to 14" × 92"
   - [ ] Attach to 2×4 frame with construction screws every 8"
   - [ ] Countersink screw heads slightly below surface

3. **Verify level:**
   - [ ] Place platform in final location
   - [ ] Use 4' level to check front-to-back and side-to-side
   - [ ] Shim under low spots (critical: must be perfectly level)
   - [ ] Once level, mark shim locations for reinstallation

**Toe kick design options:**

**Option A: Simple recessed (easiest):**
- Set platform back 3" from front edge
- Creates shadow line
- No additional trim needed

**Option B: Applied panel (medium):**
- Build platform full depth
- Add decorative front panel (beadboard, shiplap)
- More farmhouse character

**Option C: Furniture legs (advanced):**
- Build lower platform (2" high)
- Add 2" turned furniture legs at corners
- Most custom look, requires more time

**RECOMMENDATION for first build: Option A (simple recessed)**

---

## Phase 4: Cabinet Box Assembly (Weekend 2, Day 1 - Afternoon)

### Step 9: Dry Fit First Cabinet (30 minutes)

**Before glue, assemble without:**
- [ ] Lay out all parts for Cabinet 1
- [ ] Insert bottom into dados (if using)
- [ ] Position sides
- [ ] Position top
- [ ] Drive pocket screws (no glue yet)
- [ ] Check for square (measure diagonals)
- [ ] Check for gaps or misalignments

**What to verify:**
- All parts fit together?
- Cabinet is square (diagonals within ⅛")?
- No twisting or racking?
- Pocket screws drive properly?

**If problems found:**
- Adjust parts
- Re-drill pocket holes if needed
- Fix now before glue makes it permanent

**After dry fit:**
- [ ] Disassemble
- [ ] Note any adjustments needed
- [ ] Prepare for glue-up

---

### Step 10: Glue-Up First Cabinet (1 hour)

**Preparation:**
- [ ] Clear assembly area
- [ ] Have glue, clamps, screws, and square within reach
- [ ] Have damp cloth for glue squeeze-out
- [ ] Review plan one more time

**Assembly sequence (work quickly, glue sets in 15 minutes):**

1. **Attach bottom to sides:**
   - [ ] Apply glue to dado (if using dados)
   - [ ] Insert bottom into left side dado
   - [ ] Insert bottom into right side dado
   - [ ] Apply glue to pocket hole joints (if no dados)
   - [ ] Drive pocket screws to secure bottom to sides
   - [ ] Check for square, adjust if needed

2. **Attach top:**
   - [ ] Apply glue to top edge of side pieces
   - [ ] Position top
   - [ ] Drive pocket screws from sides into top (3 screws each side)
   - [ ] Check for square again

3. **Clamp cabinet:**
   - [ ] Apply bar clamps across width (top and bottom)
   - [ ] Tighten clamps (gentle pressure, not gorilla tight)
   - [ ] Verify square one more time (measure diagonals)
   - [ ] Adjust clamps if needed to bring into square

4. **Clean up:**
   - [ ] Wipe glue squeeze-out with damp cloth (do this immediately)
   - [ ] Remove excess glue from interior
   - [ ] Verify all joints tight

5. **Let cure:**
   - [ ] Leave clamps on for 1 hour minimum
   - [ ] Let glue cure overnight before moving cabinet
   - [ ] Don't attach back yet

---

### Step 11: Repeat for Remaining Cabinets (2-3 hours)

**Build Cabinet 2:**
- [ ] Dry fit
- [ ] Glue-up
- [ ] Clamp
- [ ] Clean
- [ ] Let cure

**Build Cabinet 3:**
- [ ] Dry fit
- [ ] Glue-up
- [ ] Clamp
- [ ] Clean
- [ ] Let cure

**Each subsequent cabinet faster:**
- First cabinet: 60 minutes
- Second cabinet: 45 minutes
- Third cabinet: 30 minutes

**Total for all three: 3-4 hours including dry fits**

---

### Step 12: Install Cabinet Backs (1 hour - next day)

**Why wait until next day:**
- Glue fully cured
- Can handle cabinets without stress

**Back installation sequence:**

1. **Measure actual cabinet dimensions:**
   - [ ] Measure width and height of assembled cabinet box
   - [ ] Cut ¼" plywood back to exact dimensions
   - [ ] Test fit (should be exact, no gaps)

2. **Square cabinet with back:**
   - [ ] Lay cabinet face-down
   - [ ] Position back on cabinet
   - [ ] Check diagonals (back will square the cabinet)
   - [ ] Adjust cabinet box to match back if needed

3. **Attach back:**
   - [ ] Apply small bead of glue around cabinet perimeter
   - [ ] Position back
   - [ ] Attach with brad nails every 6" around perimeter
   - [ ] OR use finish nails and hammer if no brad nailer

**Result: Cabinet box is now rigid and square**

---

## Phase 5: Face Frames (Weekend 2, Day 2 - if adding to kitchen side)

### Step 13: Build Face Frames (3 hours)

**Only if adding face frames to kitchen-facing side:**

**Materials:**
- 1×2 poplar (or paint-grade pine)
- Pocket hole screws
- Wood glue

**Face frame dimensions:**
- Match cabinet box width and height
- Rails (horizontal): 1×2
- Stiles (vertical): 1×2
- Top rail: 1×3 or 1×6 (if adding crown molding later)

**Construction:**
- [ ] Cut rails and stiles to size
- [ ] Drill pocket holes on back side of rails
- [ ] Dry fit frame
- [ ] Glue and screw together
- [ ] Check for square
- [ ] Clamp and let dry

**Repeat for all three cabinets:**
- Build all three frames in one session
- Batch process is faster

---

### Step 14: Attach Face Frames to Cabinet Boxes (1 hour)

**Attachment methods:**

**Option A: Glue + brad nails (preferred):**
- [ ] Apply glue to cabinet box front edges
- [ ] Position face frame flush with edges
- [ ] Clamp in place
- [ ] Brad nail through face frame into cabinet box every 8"
- [ ] Wipe excess glue

**Option B: Glue + pocket screws from interior:**
- [ ] Apply glue to cabinet box edges
- [ ] Position face frame
- [ ] Clamp
- [ ] Drive pocket screws from inside cabinet box into face frame back
- [ ] No visible fasteners

**Alignment critical:**
- Face frame must be perfectly flush with cabinet top and sides
- Any misalignment visible when doors installed

**Let dry overnight before proceeding**

---

## Phase 6: Sanding and Finishing Prep (Weekend 3, Day 1)

### Step 15: Sand Exterior Surfaces (2 hours)

**Now that assembly complete, sand exteriors:**

**Cabinet boxes:**
- [ ] Sand all exterior faces (120, 150, 220 grit progression)
- [ ] Sand face frames (if added)
- [ ] Fill pocket holes with wood filler if any visible
- [ ] Let filler dry, sand flush
- [ ] Ease sharp edges (light sanding on corners)

**Living room panel:**
- [ ] Sand both faces (this panel is visible from living room)
- [ ] 120, 150, 220 progression
- [ ] Pay extra attention - this is focal point

**Toe kick platform:**
- [ ] Sand top and front edge
- [ ] Fill screw holes if visible
- [ ] Sand flush

**After sanding:**
- [ ] Vacuum all surfaces
- [ ] Wipe with tack cloth
- [ ] Inspect for defects (fix now before finishing)

---

### Step 16: Seal/Prime Before Final Assembly (4 hours)

**Why finish before installing:**
- Easier to paint/finish flat
- Can finish all surfaces (including hidden areas)
- Better coverage, less masking

**Prime all parts separately:**
- [ ] Cabinet boxes (exterior and interior if desired)
- [ ] Face frames
- [ ] Living room panel (BOTH sides - this is critical)
- [ ] Toe kick platform visible surfaces

**Priming tips:**
- Use quality primer (Zinsser B-I-N or BIN 123)
- Thin coats better than thick (prevents runs)
- Sand lightly between coats with 220 grit
- Let dry completely (follow manufacturer time)

**Number of primer coats:** 2 coats minimum for paint-grade finish

**Drying time:** 4-6 hours between coats, overnight before paint

---

## Phase 7: Painting/Finishing (Weekend 3, Day 2)

### Step 17: Apply Finish Coats (4 hours + drying)

**Paint specifications:** (See WS6 for detailed finishing)
- Paint color: Modern farmhouse white/cream
- Sheen: Satin or semi-gloss (wipeable)
- Coats: 2-3 for full coverage

**Painting sequence:**

**Coat 1:**
- [ ] Paint all primed surfaces
- [ ] Thin, even coats
- [ ] Watch for runs and sags
- [ ] Let dry 4-6 hours

**Light sanding:**
- [ ] 220 grit very light sanding
- [ ] Just to knock down any nibs
- [ ] Wipe with tack cloth

**Coat 2:**
- [ ] Second paint coat
- [ ] Check coverage
- [ ] Let dry overnight

**Coat 3 (if needed):**
- [ ] Apply if coverage not perfect
- [ ] Final coat

**Drying before assembly:** 24 hours minimum, 72 hours ideal

---

## Phase 8: Final Assembly and Installation (Weekend 4, Day 1)

### Step 18: Install Toe Kick Platform (30 minutes)

**In final location:**
- [ ] Position platform where bar will sit
- [ ] Check level (critical)
- [ ] Shim as needed
- [ ] Verify level again (must be perfect)
- [ ] Secure to floor (construction screws into floor joists if wood, or tapcon anchors if concrete)

**Note column constraint:**
- Platform must fit around existing column
- Measure and notch as needed

---

### Step 19: Set Cabinet Boxes on Platform (1 hour)

**Placement sequence:**
- [ ] Start with cabinet furthest from column
- [ ] Set on toe kick platform
- [ ] Check level (front-to-back and side-to-side)
- [ ] Shim if needed under cabinet
- [ ] Position next cabinet
- [ ] Clamp cabinets together temporarily
- [ ] Verify all three cabinets level and aligned

**Check alignment:**
- Front edges flush?
- Top edges flush?
- Gaps between cabinets minimal?

---

### Step 20: Secure Cabinets Together and to Wall (1 hour)

**Join cabinets to each other:**
- [ ] Clamp adjacent cabinets together (face frames touching)
- [ ] Drill pilot holes through side of one cabinet into next
- [ ] Drive wood screws to join (2-3 screws per joint)
- [ ] Remove clamps

**Secure to wall (kitchen side):**
- [ ] Locate wall studs (use stud finder)
- [ ] Drill pilot holes through cabinet back into studs
- [ ] Drive 3" wood screws through back into studs
- [ ] At least 2 screws per cabinet into studs
- [ ] Verify cabinets still level after securing

**Note: Living room side will have decorative panel, so wall attachment from kitchen side only**

---

### Step 21: Install Living Room Facing Panel (2 hours)

**This is the "front" everyone sees from living room:**

**Attachment:**
- [ ] Position panel against back of cabinet boxes
- [ ] Panel should be finished on living room side (already painted/finished)
- [ ] Attach to cabinet boxes with glue + brad nails from interior
- [ ] OR use figure-8 fasteners (hidden, allows expansion)
- [ ] Verify panel is plumb and flush with cabinet top

**Alignment critical:**
- Panel is focal point
- Any gaps or misalignment immediately visible
- Take time to get perfect

**Seal edges:**
- Small bead of caulk at top edge (where panel meets future countertop)
- Caulk at floor (where panel meets floor)

---

## Phase 9: Doors, Drawers, and Hardware (Weekend 4, Day 2)

### Step 22: Install Adjustable Shelf Pins (30 minutes)

**If cabinets have adjustable shelves:**
- [ ] Mark shelf pin hole locations (use template or jig)
- [ ] Drill holes with ¼" or 5mm bit
- [ ] Depth: ½" (use depth stop or tape on bit)
- [ ] Install pins
- [ ] Cut shelves to size
- [ ] Place shelves on pins

---

### Step 23: Install Drawer Slides (1 hour per drawer)

**Preparation:**
- [ ] Read slide manufacturer instructions (all brands different)
- [ ] Separate cabinet-mounted from drawer-mounted parts

**Installation:**
- [ ] Mount cabinet part of slide to cabinet interior
- [ ] Use level to ensure slide is level
- [ ] Attach drawer part to drawer box
- [ ] Test fit drawer (should glide smoothly)
- [ ] Adjust if binding

---

### Step 24: Hang Doors (2 hours)

**Hinge installation:**

**For European cup hinges (frameless cabinets):**
- [ ] Mark hinge cup locations on door back (35mm from edge, 2" from top/bottom)
- [ ] Drill 35mm holes with Forstner bit
- [ ] Install hinge cups in doors
- [ ] Mount hinge plates to cabinet sides
- [ ] Attach doors to cabinet
- [ ] Adjust for even gaps (hinges have 3-way adjustment)

**For traditional butt hinges (face frame cabinets):**
- [ ] Mark hinge locations on door and face frame
- [ ] Chisel mortises for hinges (flush mount)
- [ ] Attach hinges to door
- [ ] Position door on cabinet
- [ ] Screw hinges to face frame
- [ ] Check swing and gaps
- [ ] Adjust as needed

**Door alignment:**
- Even gaps all around (⅛" typical)
- Doors sit flush with face frame or cabinet edge
- Doors close smoothly without binding

---

### Step 25: Install Handles/Knobs (30 minutes)

**Preparation:**
- [ ] Measure and mark handle/knob locations
- [ ] Use template for consistent placement
- [ ] Drill holes for handles (typically 3" or 3¾" centers)

**Installation:**
- [ ] Insert machine screws from interior of door/drawer
- [ ] Thread into handle/knob
- [ ] Tighten (don't overtighten, can crack door)

**Consistent placement critical:**
- All handles at same height
- Centered on doors/drawers
- Use template for consistency

---

## Phase 10: Countertop Installation (Separate timeline)

### Step 26: Template for Countertop (1 hour)

**This happens after cabinets complete:**
- [ ] Verify cabinet boxes level and secured
- [ ] Create template of cabinet top (use cardboard or thin plywood)
- [ ] Mark any notches (for column)
- [ ] Measure overhang desired (typically 1" front, flush back)
- [ ] Provide template to butcher block supplier or fabricator

**See WS2 for butcher block sourcing and installation details**

---

## Finish Before vs. After Assembly - Decision Tree

### What to Finish BEFORE Assembly

**Interior surfaces:**
- [ ] Sand before assembly (can't reach after)
- [ ] Optional: Apply sealer to interiors (makes cleaning easier)
- [ ] Only if desired - not required

**Advantages:**
- Can finish flat
- Easier brush access
- No "cutting in"

**Disadvantages:**
- More parts to manage
- Finish can chip during assembly
- Harder to blend touch-ups

---

### What to Finish AFTER Assembly

**Exterior surfaces (RECOMMENDED):**
- [ ] Prime and paint after cabinet boxes assembled
- [ ] Allows filling of any joint gaps
- [ ] Can sand entire assembly smooth
- [ ] Blends any touch-ups

**Advantages:**
- Seamless finish across joints
- Can fill gaps with caulk/filler
- Easier to manage (one piece instead of many)
- Professional results

**Disadvantages:**
- Harder to reach interiors (but they're hidden anyway)
- Need to protect surrounding areas

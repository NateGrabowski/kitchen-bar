---

## Tool Ownership Status

### Already Owned (Per Project Specs)
- Table saw
- Miter saw
- Router

### Need to Acquire
See sections below for prioritized list

---

## MUST HAVE Tools

### 1. Pocket Hole Jig - PRIMARY NEW PURCHASE

**Recommended: Kreg K5 Pocket-Hole Jig**
- **Cost:** $140-150
- **Why this model:**
  - Adjustable for ¾" plywood (our cabinet box material)
  - Built-in clamp holds work securely
  - Hardened steel drill guide (long-lasting)
  - Includes dust collection port
  - Step-up from basic R3 but not as expensive as K5MS

**Budget alternative: Kreg R3**
- **Cost:** $40-50
- **Tradeoffs:**
  - Manual clamping required (slower)
  - Plastic construction (less durable)
  - No dust collection
  - Still functional for this project

**Premium option: Kreg K5MS (Master System)**
- **Cost:** $230-250
- **Additional features:**
  - Face clamp included
  - More versatile for future projects
  - Auto-adjust material thickness
  - Overkill for our needs unless building many cabinets

**RECOMMENDATION: Kreg K5** - Best balance of cost, features, and durability

**Where to buy:**
- Home Depot: In stock, can see in person
- Amazon: Fast shipping, often has deals
- Rockler or Woodcraft: Expert advice available

---

### 2. Drill/Driver - VERIFY IF ADEQUATE

**You likely already own, but verify:**
- Cordless drill/driver with 18V+ battery
- Adjustable torque (prevents overdriving screws)
- Compatible with #2 square drive bits (for pocket screws)

**If purchasing new: DeWalt DCD771C2 or Milwaukee 2701-20**
- **Cost:** $80-120 with battery
- **Both are reliable for cabinet building**

**Critical: Impact driver NOT recommended for pocket screws**
- Too much torque, can strip holes or crack plywood
- Regular drill/driver better for controlled driving

---

### 3. Measuring and Marking Tools

**Essential measuring tools:**

**24" or 25' Tape Measure**
- Already owned (assumed)
- Verify it's accurate and lock mechanism works
- **Cost if needed:** $15-25

**Combination Square (12")**
- Check for 90° accuracy
- Used for marking cut lines and checking assembly
- **Recommended:** Irwin or Empire
- **Cost:** $15-30

**Speed Square**
- Critical for checking cabinet box square during assembly
- Aluminum construction (won't rust)
- **Recommended:** Swanson or Empire
- **Cost:** $8-15

**Pencil + Pencil Sharpener**
- **Use sharp pencil or marking knife** - Dull pencils add measurement error
- Mechanical pencil (0.5mm or 0.7mm) ideal
- **Cost:** $3-8

**24" or 48" Level**
- For toe kick platform and cabinet installation
- Verify accuracy before using (test on known level surface)
- **Cost if needed:** $20-40

---

### 4. Clamps - CRITICAL, Often Underestimated

**Minimum clamp requirements:**

**4x 24" or 36" Bar Clamps (Parallel Jaw)**
- Hold cabinet sides during glue-up
- Parallel jaws distribute pressure evenly
- **Recommended:** Bessey or Jorgensen
- **Cost:** $25-40 each = $100-160 total

**4x Spring Clamps (4" jaw)**
- Hold face frames during assembly
- Secure backs while brad nails dry
- **Cost:** $3-5 each = $12-20 total

**2x 48" Pipe Clamps (Optional but helpful)**
- For full cabinet width clamping
- Can purchase pipe separately and add clamp heads
- **Cost:** $15 per head + $10 per pipe = $50 total

**Clamp strategy if budget limited:**
- Start with 4 bar clamps minimum
- Add more as budget allows (can never have too many)
- Clamps are lifetime tools, buy quality

---

### 5. Safety Equipment - NON-NEGOTIABLE

**Safety Glasses**
- ANSI Z87.1 rated
- Comfortable for extended wear
- **Cost:** $10-20

**Hearing Protection**
- Table saw and router are loud (90+ dB)
- Foam ear plugs OR over-ear muffs
- **Cost:** $5-25

**Dust Mask or Respirator**
- N95 masks minimum for plywood dust
- Upgrade to P100 respirator if budget allows
- **Cost:** $15-60

**First Aid Kit**
- Band-aids, antiseptic, gauze
- Keep in shop at all times
- **Cost:** $20-30

---

### 6. Consumable Cutting/Drilling Items

**Drill Bits for Pocket Hole Jig**
- Included with Kreg jigs, but spares recommended
- Kreg stepped drill bit (⅜" coarse thread)
- **Cost for spare:** $12-15

**#2 Square Drive Bits (10-pack)**
- Pocket screws use square drive
- Bits wear out, have backups
- **Cost:** $8-12

**Table Saw Blade - CRITICAL UPGRADE**
- **60-80 tooth plywood blade** - Prevents tearout on veneer
- Your existing blade may not be suitable for cabinet-grade plywood
- **Recommended:** Freud Diablo or Forrest Woodworker II
- **Cost:** $40-150 (Diablo $40, Forrest $150)
- **RECOMMENDATION: Freud Diablo** - Excellent for cost

**Router Bit (if using dados)**
- ¾" straight cutting bit
- Carbide tipped
- **Cost:** $15-30

---

## NICE TO HAVE Tools

### 1. Brad Nailer (18-gauge)

**Purpose:**
- Attach cabinet backs (¼" plywood)
- Secure face frames to cabinet boxes
- Trim and molding installation

**Manual alternative:** Hammer + finish nails (slower, less precise)

**Recommended models:**

**Pneumatic (requires air compressor):**
- Ryobi or Porter-Cable brad nailer
- **Cost:** $50-80 (nailer only)
- **+ Air compressor:** $150-300
- **Total:** $200-380
- **Pro:** Unlimited runtime, lightweight
- **Con:** Requires compressor and hose (less portable)

**Cordless (battery-powered):**
- DeWalt DCN680 or Ryobi P320
- **Cost:** $150-200 with battery
- **Pro:** No hose, very portable, quieter
- **Con:** Battery runtime limits

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- **If you have air compressor:** Pneumatic brad nailer
- **If no compressor:** Wait on this purchase, use hammer + finish nails for this project

---

### 2. Random Orbit Sander

**Purpose:**
- Sand cabinet boxes before finishing
- Smooth plywood edges after edge banding
- Prep surfaces for paint

**Manual alternative:** Sanding by hand (time-consuming but functional)

**Recommended: DeWalt DWE6423K or Makita BO5041K**
- **Cost:** $60-80
- **Features:** 5" pad, variable speed, dust collection

**Skip if:**
- Budget is tight
- Don't mind hand sanding
- Can borrow from friend/neighbor

---

### 3. Track Saw or Circular Saw with Guide

**Purpose:**
- Break down 4'×8' plywood sheets
- Make straight, accurate cuts without table saw

**Your situation:**
- You have table saw (may be adequate)
- Plywood sheets awkward on table saw alone

**Options:**

**Budget: Circular saw + straightedge guide**
- Likely already own circular saw
- Buy/make straightedge guide ($20-50)
- Clamp guide to plywood, run saw along edge
- **Cost:** $20-50 if making guide, $80-120 for commercial guide (Kreg Rip-Cut)

**Premium: Track saw (Makita, Festool, DeWalt)**
- **Cost:** $300-600
- **Overkill for this project** unless doing lots of sheet goods work

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- Use table saw with helper or infeed/outfeed support
- OR make circular saw guide from scrap plywood + straight edge
- Don't buy track saw for one project

---

### 4. Dado Blade Set (if not using router for dados)

**Purpose:**
- Cut dados on table saw (faster than router)
- Create grooves for cabinet backs
- Rabbet joints if desired

**Cost:** $80-200
- Budget: Freud or DeWalt 8" dado set ($80-120)
- Premium: Freud Super Dado ($180-200)

**Alternative:** Use router with straight bit (you already own router)

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- Skip dado blade, use router for dados
- Saves $80-200
- Router with straightedge guide works great for our limited dado needs

---

### 5. Doweling Jig

**Purpose:**
- Drill perfectly aligned holes for dowel joinery
- Alternative to pocket holes for face frames

**Cost:** $40-100

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- Skip this, we're using pocket holes
- Only relevant if abandoning pocket hole method

---

### 6. Router Table

**Purpose:**
- Easier edge profiling
- More controlled dado cuts
- Consistent repeated cuts

**Cost:** $150-400 for pre-built

**Alternative:** Use router handheld with guides (you already have router)

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- Skip for this project
- Handheld router adequate for occasional dados
- Build router table in future if needed

---

### 7. Miter Saw Stand

**Purpose:**
- Support long boards during crosscuts
- Makes miter saw more portable

**Cost:** $80-200

**Alternative:** Sawhorses or workbench

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- Only if you don't have good miter saw support currently
- Sawhorses work fine for this project

---

## RENTAL Suggestions

---

### 2. Biscuit Joiner

**When to rent:**
- If you decide to use biscuit joinery instead of pocket holes

**RECOMMENDATION:** Don't rent, we're using pocket holes

---

### 3. Air Compressor + Brad Nailer Kit

**When to rent:**
- For cabinet back installation and trim work
- Don't want to buy nailer for one project

**Cost:** $30-50 per day

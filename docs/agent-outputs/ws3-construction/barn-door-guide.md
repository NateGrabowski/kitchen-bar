# Barn Door Construction and Installation Guide

**Project:** Kitchen Bar Cabinet - Barn Door Section (30" Opening)
**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Purpose:** Complete X-panel barn door construction, hardware selection, and installation

---

## Barn Door Specifications

### Cabinet Opening

**Door section dimensions:**
- Opening width: 30"
- Opening height: 34.5" (cabinet body)
- Purpose: Conceals storage area

**Barn door design:**
- Single door sliding left
- X-panel farmhouse style
- Closes to cover 30" opening completely
- Opens to stack on left (requires track beyond opening)

---

## Barn Door vs. Traditional Hinged Door

### Why Barn Door for This Application

**Advantages:**
- Modern farmhouse aesthetic (design goal)
- No door swing clearance needed
- Visual interest (focal point from living room)
- Easy one-hand operation
- Aligns with current design trends

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires track installation
- More expensive than hinges ($40-80 vs. $10)
- Door always visible (doesn't "go away" when open)
- Requires wall space for door to slide onto

**Decision: Barn door locked in** (matches modern farmhouse style requirement)

---

## Door Dimensions and Clearances

### Door Size Calculation

**Width calculation:**
- Opening width: 30"
- Overlap for coverage: +1" (½" each side)
- **Door width: 30"** (meets opening exactly in this case)

**Note on overlap:**
Standard practice: door width = opening + 1"
Our case: 30" door on 30" opening works because:
- Living room panel provides backing
- ½" gap each side is acceptable (not pass-through)
- Hardware selected covers gaps

**Height calculation:**
- Opening height: 34.5"
- Top overlap: +1" (covers top rail)
- Bottom clearance: -½" (allows door to slide over uneven floor)
- **Door height: 35"**

**Final door size: 30" W × 35" H**

### Thickness

**¾" plywood** (same as cabinet boxes)
- Adequate strength
- Matches cabinet construction
- Standard for barn doors
- Provides surface for X-panel detail

---

## X-Panel Door Construction

### Design Options

**Option 1: X on face (applied trim method - RECOMMENDED)**
- ¾" plywood door panel (30" × 35")
- 1×4 trim boards applied to face in X pattern
- Frame around perimeter
- Easiest to build
- Most forgiving

**Option 2: Routed X-panel (advanced)**
- Route grooves into solid plywood
- Looks built-in, not applied
- Requires router template
- More time-consuming
- Difficult to achieve clean result

**Option 3: Shiplap door with X-brace**
- Horizontal shiplap boards
- X-brace on back for structure
- More rustic look
- Board alignment critical

**LOCKED CHOICE: Option 1 (Applied trim method)**
- Fastest build
- Professional appearance
- Matches modern farmhouse aesthetic
- Allows customization of trim profile

---

## Materials for X-Panel Door

### Door Panel (Base)

**¾" plywood: 30" × 35"**
- Cut from one of the cabinet plywood sheets
- OR purchase separately if using different species/finish
- Select face plywood (birch, maple, or paint-grade)

**Cutting the panel:**
- Circular saw + straightedge guide (see ADDENDUM-no-table-saw.md)
- OR have big box store cut to size
- Square corners critical for smooth sliding

---

### Trim for X-Frame and Border

**Perimeter frame:**
- Material: 1×4 pine, poplar, or MDF (paint-grade)
- Length needed: (30" + 30" + 35" + 35") = 130 linear inches = 11 feet
- Purchase: Two 6' boards (12' total)
- Miter corners at 45° for frame

**X-diagonal trim:**
- Material: 1×4 or 1×3 (can be narrower for visual variety)
- Calculate diagonal length:
  - Door interior after frame: ~26" W × 31" H
  - Diagonal = √(26² + 31²) = √(676 + 961) = √1637 = 40.5"
  - Need TWO diagonals: 2 × 41" = 82"
  - Purchase: One 8' board covers both

**Total lumber:**
- 1×4 boards: 12 feet (frame) + 8 feet (X) = 20 linear feet
- Typical 1×4 prices: $8-12 per 8' board
- Total: 3 boards @ $10 each = $30

**Fasteners:**
- Brad nails: 1¼" (attach trim to plywood)
- Wood glue
- Finish nails if no brad nailer available

---

## Step-by-Step Door Construction

### Phase 1: Cut and Prepare Door Panel

**Cut plywood panel:**
1. Measure and mark 30" × 35" rectangle on ¾" plywood
2. Use circular saw + straightedge OR have store cut
3. Verify corners are square (measure diagonals)
4. Sand all edges smooth (120 grit)

**Determine face orientation:**
- Best face OUT (living room side)
- Mark back of panel (interior face)
- Trim will go on living room side

---

### Phase 2: Build Perimeter Frame

**Cut frame pieces:**

**Horizontal (top and bottom):**
- 2 pieces at 30" length
- Miter both ends at 45°

**Vertical (left and right):**
- 2 pieces at 35" length
- Miter both ends at 45°

**Miter saw setup:**
- Set saw to 45° angle
- Make test cuts on scrap (verify angle)
- Cut all 4 pieces with miters

**Attach frame to panel:**

1. **Dry fit frame around panel edge**
   - Miters should meet cleanly
   - Frame flush with panel edges
   - Adjust if needed

2. **Glue and nail frame**
   - Apply wood glue to back of frame piece
   - Position on panel edge
   - Brad nail through frame into plywood edge (every 6-8")
   - Wipe glue squeeze-out
   - Repeat for all 4 sides

3. **Let dry**
   - Clamp if miters have gaps
   - 30 minutes minimum

**Frame should be flush with panel, creating raised border**

---

### Phase 3: Create and Attach X-Diagonal Trim

**Calculate X-diagonal angles:**

**Method: Measure and mark on actual door**
1. Lay door face-up
2. Measure interior of frame (space inside border)
   - Example: 26" wide × 31" tall (after 2" frame)
3. Mark X corners:
   - Top left to bottom right
   - Top right to bottom left
4. X diagonals cross in center

**Cut diagonal trim:**

**Angle calculation:**
- Diagonals run corner to corner of interior rectangle
- Each end needs compound miter to fit against frame
- Easiest method: Mark in place, cut to fit

**Steps:**
1. Place 1×4 diagonal from corner to corner
2. Mark where it intersects frame edges
3. Cut with miter saw (angle matches diagonal, ~40-45°)
4. Test fit
5. Trim if needed for snug fit
6. Repeat for second diagonal

**Attach X-trim:**
1. Determine crossing order (which piece goes on top)
2. Glue and nail first diagonal in place
3. Glue and nail second diagonal (overlap at center)
4. Brad nail every 8-10" along length
5. Nail at crossing point (through both pieces)

**Result: Plywood panel with frame border and X-pattern trim**

---

### Phase 4: Sand and Finish Door

**Sanding:**
- 120 grit: Remove mill marks, smooth transitions
- 150 grit: Refine
- 220 grit: Final smooth for paint
- Ease sharp edges on trim

**Finishing:**

**Option 1: Paint to match cabinets (recommended)**
- Prime all surfaces (front, back, edges)
- Two coats quality paint
- Satin or semi-gloss sheen
- Same color as cabinet boxes

**Option 2: Contrast color**
- Dark door on white cabinets (bold)
- Adds visual interest
- Creates focal point

**Option 3: Stain and clear coat**
- Requires solid wood trim (not MDF)
- Contrasts with painted cabinets
- More rustic farmhouse look

**RECOMMENDED: Paint to match cabinets** (cohesive look)

**Drying:**
- Let fully dry (48-72 hours) before installing hardware
- Prevents damage to finish during handling

---

## Barn Door Hardware Selection

### Hardware Kit Components

**Complete barn door kit includes:**
- Track rail (metal bar door slides on)
- Rollers/hangers (attach to top of door)
- Floor guide (keeps bottom of door aligned)
- Optional: Soft-close mechanism
- Mounting hardware (screws, anchors)

### Track Length Calculation

**Formula: Track length = (2 × door width) + 6"**

For 30" door:
- (2 × 30") + 6" = 66"
- Minimum: 60" (allows door to fully clear opening)
- Recommended: 66-72" (more clearance, smoother operation)

**Why longer track:**
- Door must slide fully past opening to expose access
- Door thickness means it needs extra clearance
- Longer track = easier operation

**Standard track lengths:** 60", 72", 84", 96"
**Our choice: 72" track** (exceeds minimum, readily available)

---

### Hardware Style Options

**Style 1: Traditional barn door (industrial farmhouse)**
- Black steel hardware
- Visible wheels/rollers
- Heavy-duty aesthetic
- Most common for modern farmhouse

**Style 2: Minimalist track (modern farmhouse)**
- Low-profile track
- Concealed rollers
- Cleaner look
- Slightly more expensive

**Style 3: Rustic/decorative**
- Ornamental brackets
- Vintage-look hardware
- More traditional farmhouse
- Heavier appearance

**RECOMMENDED: Traditional black steel** (matches modern farmhouse, widely available)

   - Screws into ¾" plywood adequate
   - Every 12-16" is sufficient

3. **Drill pilot holes**
   - Through track mounting holes
   - Into plywood panel
   - Prevents splitting

4. **Attach track**
   - Position track on line
   - Drive screws through track into panel
   - Verify track is level (check with level)
   - Track must be perfectly level for smooth operation

5. **Test track**
   - Slide something along track
   - Should glide smoothly
   - No wobble or flex

---

### Phase 2: Attach Rollers to Door

**Roller placement:**
- Two rollers at top of door
- Spaced evenly: typically 4-6" from each edge
- Follow hardware kit instructions (spacing varies)

**Installation:**

1. **Mark roller positions**
   - Top edge of door (back side)
   - 4-6" from each side edge
   - Centered on door thickness

2. **Attach roller brackets**
   - Drill pilot holes
   - Screw brackets to top edge of door
   - Brackets should be plumb (perpendicular to door)

   - Adjust roller height if door not plumb
   - Most kits have adjustment screws

3. **Test slide**
   - Slide door left and right
   - Should glide smoothly
   - No binding or sticking
   - If rough, check track level and roller alignment

---

### Phase 4: Install Floor Guide

**Purpose:**
- Keeps bottom of door aligned
- Prevents door from swinging away from cabinet
- Small bracket mounted to floor or cabinet base

**Installation:**

1. **Position door in closed position**
2. **Mark floor guide location**
   - At bottom of door, centered on width
   - Guide should loosely capture door edge
   - Allows door to slide but not swing
3. **Mount floor guide**
   - Screw to floor OR toe kick platform
   - Door should slide through guide bracket
   - Not too tight (prevents sliding)

---

### Phase 5: Install Soft-Close (if included)

**Soft-close damper installation:**

1. **Locate damper mounting position**
   - Per kit instructions
   - Typically at closed end of track
   - Engages last 4-6" of door travel

2. **Attach damper to track**
   - Clips or screws to track
   - Position so door engages damper when closing

3. **Test and adjust**
   - Close door, verify soft-close engages
   - Adjust damper position if needed
   - Door should slow gently, not stop abruptly

---

## Door Pull/Handle Selection

### Handle Placement

**Barn door pulls (flush or semi-recessed):**
- Centered horizontally on door
- Vertical position: 36-40" from floor (comfortable reach)
- OR aligned with cabinet door handles

**Handle styles:**

**Flush pull (recessed):**
- Sits inside door thickness
- Doesn't protrude
- Finger grip only
- Modern look

**Cup pull:**
- Semi-recessed
- Classic farmhouse
- Easy grip
- Comfortable

**Surface-mount pull:**
- Vertical or horizontal bar
- Most grip area
- Can interfere with sliding if too large
- Choose low-profile

**RECOMMENDED: Cup pull or flush pull** (farmhouse style, doesn't interfere with slide)

### Installation

1. Measure and mark handle position
2. Drill hole(s) for handle screws
3. Install from outside, screws into back
4. Verify handle doesn't hit track or cabinet when operating

## Alternative: Cabinet Door Instead of Barn Door

**If barn door seems too complex or expensive:**

### Traditional Hinged Door Option

**Pros:**
- Less expensive ($10 hinges vs. $50 hardware)
- Simpler installation
- No track needed
- Door "disappears" when open (swings away)

**Cons:**
- Requires door swing clearance
- Less visual interest
- Not as aligned with modern farmhouse trend
- Harder to operate (needs handle pull, not slide)

**Construction same:**
- 30" × 35" X-panel door (same as barn door)
- Mount with European cup hinges or butt hinges
- Handle on opposite side from hinges

**When to consider:**
- Budget very tight (saves $40)
- Don't like barn door aesthetic
- Prefer traditional look

**Our project: BARN DOOR LOCKED IN** (design requirement)

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Door sticks or binds

**Causes:**
- Track not level
- Rollers damaged or dirty
- Floor guide too tight

**Fixes:**
- Check track with level, shim if needed
- Clean rollers, verify they spin
- Loosen floor guide (should guide, not grip)

### Problem: Door swings away from cabinet

**Cause:** Floor guide not installed or positioned wrong

**Fix:**
- Install floor guide at bottom of door
- Position so door can slide but not swing

### Problem: Soft-close too strong or too weak

**Cause:** Damper position or adjustment

**Fix:**
- Some dampers have adjustment screw
- Reposition damper engagement point
- Check kit instructions

### Problem: Door doesn't cover opening completely

**Cause:** Door too narrow, or track starts too far from edge

**Fix:**
- Verify door width (should be 30" minimum)
- Reposition track closer to opening edge
- May need wider door (rebuild)

### Problem: Rollers loud or squeaky

**Cause:** Rollers need lubrication or are low quality

**Fix:**
- Apply silicone spray to rollers and track
- Verify rollers seated properly in track
- Cheap hardware may need upgrade

---

## Design Variations

### X-Pattern Alternatives

**If full X too bold:**

**Option 1: Partial X**
- X in upper or lower half only
- Horizontal board divides door
- Less busy appearance

**Option 2: Z-pattern**
- Horizontal top, horizontal bottom, diagonal between
- Classic barn door look
- Simpler than X

**Option 3: Vertical planks (board and batten)**
- 3-5 vertical 1×4 boards
- Simpler construction
- More traditional farmhouse

**Option 4: Recessed panel**
- Frame with flat center panel
- Shaker-style
- More modern, less rustic

**Locked choice for our project: Full X-pattern** (iconic, farmhouse, visually balanced)

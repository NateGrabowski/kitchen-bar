# Drawer Construction Guide

**Project:** Kitchen Bar Cabinet - Triple Drawer Bank (30" Section)
**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Purpose:** Complete drawer box construction and hardware installation

---

## Drawer Configuration

### Triple Drawer Bank Specifications

**Opening dimensions:**
- Width: 30" (cabinet interior)
- Height: 34.5" (cabinet body, minus top rail/trim)
- Depth: 14" (cabinet depth)

**Drawer layout:**
- 3 equal-height drawers
- Stack configuration (top to bottom)
- Full-extension soft-close slides

---

## Drawer Size Calculations

### Industry Standard Sizing

**Gap allowances:**
- ½" side clearance (¼" each side for slides)
- ½" height clearance (¼" top, ¼" bottom)
- Face frame overlap if applicable

**For 30" wide opening:**

**Drawer box width (interior to interior of cabinet):**
- Opening width: 30"
- Minus slide clearance: -½" (¼" per side)
- **Drawer box width: 29½"**

**Drawer height calculation:**

Total available height: 34.5" (cabinet body)
Minus top rail/divider: -1.5"
Minus bottom rail: -1.5"
**Available for drawers: 31.5"**

Divide by 3 drawers: 31.5" ÷ 3 = 10.5" per drawer opening

**Per drawer:**
- Drawer opening: 10.5"
- Minus clearance: -¼" top and bottom = -½"
- **Drawer box height: 10"**

**Drawer depth:**
- Cabinet depth: 14"
- Full extension slides = drawer can be cabinet depth
- Minus 1" for face clearance
- **Drawer box depth: 13"**

### Final Drawer Box Dimensions

**Each drawer box (3 identical):**
- Width: 29½"
- Height: 10"
- Depth: 13"

**Drawer fronts (applied separately):**
- Width: 30" (full opening width)
- Height: 10½" (opening + ¼" overlap top and bottom)
- Thickness: ¾"

## Drawer Box Construction Method

### Recommended: Pocket Hole Assembly

**Why pocket holes for drawers:**
- Fast assembly (matches cabinet construction)
- Strong enough for drawer duty
- You already have the jig
- Hidden inside drawer box

### Alternative Methods Considered

**Dovetails:**
- Traditional, beautiful
- Time-consuming (2-3 hours per drawer)
- Requires jig or hand-cut skills
- Overkill for painted drawers

**Rabbet/dado:**
- Strong, professional
- Requires table saw with dado blade (don't have)
- OR router setup for each drawer
- More complex than needed

**Butt joints with glue and nails:**
- Weakest option
- Drawers take lateral stress
- Not recommended

**LOCKED DECISION: Pocket hole construction with ½" plywood**

---

## Materials for Drawer Boxes

### Plywood Selection

**Recommended: ½" Baltic birch plywood**
- **Why ½" instead of ¾":**
  - Lighter weight (easier drawer operation)
  - Less bulk (more interior space)
  - Adequate strength for drawer sides
  - Industry standard for drawer boxes
- **Why Baltic birch:**
  - Void-free interior (no weak spots)
  - Stable, doesn't warp
  - Smooth faces (finish not needed, inside drawer)
  - Consistent thickness

**Budget alternative: ½" cabinet-grade plywood**
- Birch or maple face
- Some interior voids acceptable (drawer not structural)
- $15-20 less per sheet than Baltic birch

**Material quantity:**
- 1 sheet of ½" × 4' × 8' plywood = 3 drawer boxes + extra

### Drawer Bottom Options

**Option 1: ¼" plywood (recommended)**
- Sits in dado groove in drawer sides
- Traditional method
- Very strong
- Requires router or table saw for dados

**Option 2: ¼" hardboard (budget)**
- Cheaper than plywood
- Sits in dado or just glued/nailed to bottom
- Adequate for light duty
- Can sag if overloaded

**Option 3: ½" plywood (simplest)**
- Same as drawer sides
- Attach with pocket screws from sides
- No dado required
- Slightly reduces interior height
- Heavier

**RECOMMENDED: ¼" plywood in dado groove** (strongest, most professional)

**If no dado capability: ½" plywood with pocket screws** (simpler, adequate)

---

## Drawer Box Cut List

### For ONE Drawer (Multiply by 3)

**½" plywood:**
- Front: 29½" wide × 10" tall (1 piece)
- Back: 29½" wide × 10" tall (1 piece)
- Sides: 13" deep × 10" tall (2 pieces)

**¼" plywood (if using dado method):**
- Bottom: 29" × 12½" (1 piece)
  - Fits in ¼" dado, ¼" from bottom edge
  - Slightly undersized for easier fit

**OR ½" plywood (if using pocket screw method):**
- Bottom: 29½" × 13" (1 piece)
  - Full size, attaches to bottom edges

### Total Material for 3 Drawers

**½" plywood needed:**
- 6 pieces at 29½" × 10" (fronts and backs)
- 6 pieces at 13" × 10" (sides)

**From one 4'×8' sheet:**
- Rip sheet to 10" height strips (8' ÷ 10" = 9 strips available)
- Crosscut strips to length (29½" or 13")
- **Result: One sheet makes 3+ drawer boxes with material to spare**

**¼" plywood needed (if using):**
- 3 bottoms at 29" × 12½"
- **Can cut from scraps OR buy 2'×4' piece at store**

---

## Step-by-Step Construction

### Phase 1: Cutting Drawer Parts

**Cutting ½" plywood:**

**METHOD 1 (No table saw - Recommended):**
1. Have store rip ½" plywood to 10" width strips
2. Bring home 10" × 96" strips
3. Miter saw: crosscut to 29½" (fronts/backs)
4. Miter saw: crosscut to 13" (sides)

**METHOD 2 (Circular saw + guide):**
1. Rip to 10" height with circular saw and guide
2. Crosscut to length with miter saw or circular saw

**Cutting ¼" bottoms:**
1. Circular saw + straightedge to 29" × 12½"
2. Can also have store cut these

**CRITICAL: Label all pieces**
- Mark interior faces (pocket holes go here)
- Mark which drawer (1, 2, or 3)
- Prevents assembly errors

---

### Phase 2: Dado for Bottom (If Using)

**Skip this if using pocket screw method for bottom.**

**Dado specifications:**
- Width: ¼" (matches plywood thickness)
- Depth: ¼" (not too deep, weakens sides)
- Location: ¼" up from bottom edge

**Router method:**
1. Set up ¾" straight bit in router
2. Set depth to ¼"
3. Clamp straightedge guide to drawer side
4. Position guide ¼" from bottom edge
5. Route dado along all 4 pieces (2 fronts, 2 backs, 4 sides = wait, no)

**CORRECTION - Dado locations:**
- Front piece: dado along bottom edge
- Back piece: dado along bottom edge
- Side pieces: dado along bottom edge
- All dados ¼" from bottom, ¼" deep

**Test fit:**
- ¼" plywood should slide snugly into dado
- Not too tight (won't assemble)
- Not too loose (bottom rattles)

---

### Phase 3: Drill Pocket Holes

**Pocket hole jig setup:**
- Set for ½" material (NOT ¾" like cabinet boxes)
- Use ½" or ⅝" pocket screws (shorter than cabinet screws)
- Drill on interior faces only

**Pocket hole locations:**

**Drawer front:**
- 3 pocket holes along each side edge (for attaching to sides)
- Pocket holes on interior face (inside drawer)
- Space evenly: top, middle, bottom

**Drawer back:**
- Same as front: 3 holes each side edge
- Interior face

**Drawer sides:**
- NO pocket holes if using dado for bottom
- 3 pocket holes along bottom edge if NOT using dado (attaching bottom with screws)

**Total pocket holes per drawer (dado method):**
- Front: 6 holes
- Back: 6 holes
- Sides: 0 holes
- **Total: 12 holes per drawer**

**Total pocket holes per drawer (no dado method):**
- Front: 6 holes
- Back: 6 holes
- Sides: 6 holes (3 per side for bottom)
- **Total: 18 holes per drawer**

---

### Phase 4: Drawer Box Assembly

**Preparation:**
- Clear workspace
- Have glue, pocket screws (½" or ⅝"), clamps ready
- Dry fit first drawer before glue

**Assembly sequence:**

**Step 1: Attach sides to front**
1. Apply glue to side edge
2. Position side against interior of front piece
3. Clamp in place (or have helper hold)
4. Drive 3 pocket screws through front into side
5. Repeat for other side

**Step 2: Insert bottom (if using dado method)**
1. Slide ¼" plywood bottom into dados on front and sides
2. Apply small bead of glue in dados
3. Bottom acts as squaring guide

**Step 3: Attach back**
1. Apply glue to back edges of sides
2. Slide bottom into back dado (if using)
3. Position back piece
4. Drive pocket screws through back into sides
5. Drawer box now complete rectangle

**Step 4: Secure bottom (if using pocket screw method)**
1. Apply glue to bottom edges of front, back, and sides
2. Position ½" bottom on bottom edges
3. Drive pocket screws up through sides into bottom
4. Bottom secured

**Step 5: Check for square**
1. Measure diagonals (should be equal)
2. Adjust if needed before glue sets
3. Clamp if necessary to hold square
4. Wipe glue squeeze-out

**Step 6: Let dry**
- 30 minutes minimum before handling
- Overnight before installing slides

**Repeat for remaining 2 drawers**

---

### Phase 5: Sanding and Finishing

**Sand drawer boxes:**
- 150 grit on all exterior surfaces
- Ease sharp edges (one pass with sandpaper)
- Interior can be left rough (hidden)

**Finish options:**

**Option 1: No finish (simplest)**
- ½" plywood smooth enough unfinished
- Inside drawer, not visible
- Saves time

**Option 2: One coat sealer**
- Shellac or water-based poly
- Seals wood, makes cleaning easier
- Prevents moisture absorption
- 15 minutes per drawer

**Option 3: Paint to match cabinet interior**
- Professional touch
- One coat primer + one coat paint
- Adds time, purely aesthetic

**RECOMMENDED: One coat shellac** - quick, protective, done

## Drawer Slide Selection

### Slide Types Compared

**Side-mount slides:**
- Mount to drawer sides
- Visible when drawer open
- Load capacity: 75-100 lbs
- Budget-friendly ($8-15 per pair)
- Adequate for most kitchen drawers

**Undermount slides:**
- Mount to drawer bottom
- Hidden from view
- Load capacity: 75-120 lbs
- Premium price ($30-60 per pair)
- Professional look
- More complex installation

**Center-mount slides:**
- Single slide under drawer center
- Very budget-friendly ($5-10)
- Lower load capacity (50-75 lbs)
- Drawer can tip if loaded unevenly
- Not recommended for kitchen

**RECOMMENDED: Side-mount soft-close slides**

### Soft-Close Feature

**Why soft-close is worth it:**

## Drawer Slide Installation

### Cabinet-Mounted Part Installation

**Preparation:**
1. Read slide instructions (all brands slightly different)
2. Separate drawer-mount from cabinet-mount parts
3. Identify front and back of slide (usually marked)

**Cabinet-side installation:**

**Vertical positioning:**
- **Bottom drawer:** 2" up from cabinet bottom (allows toe kick clearance)
- **Middle drawer:** 10½" up from bottom of bottom drawer opening
- **Top drawer:** 10½" up from bottom of middle drawer opening

**OR use this method:**
- Measure from top of cabinet
- Top drawer: 2" down from cabinet top
- Middle drawer: 12½" down from cabinet top
- Bottom drawer: 23" down from cabinet top

**Horizontal positioning:**
- Slide mounts flush with front edge of cabinet interior
- OR set back per manufacturer specs (some slides need ⅛" setback)
- Extends to back of cabinet

**Installation steps:**
1. Mark horizontal line on cabinet side at correct height
2. Use level to ensure line is perfectly level
3. Position cabinet-mount part on line, flush with front
4. Drill pilot holes for screws (critical - prevents splitting)
5. Drive screws to secure slide
6. Check slide is level before final tightening
7. Repeat for opposite side (must be exactly same height!)

**Verification:**
- Both slides at same height? (Measure from bottom on both sides)
- Both slides level? (Use level on each slide)
- Slides fully extended and retract smoothly?

---

### Drawer-Mounted Part Installation

**Positioning on drawer:**
- Drawer-mount part attaches to bottom edge of drawer side
- Flush with front of drawer
- Check manufacturer specs for exact placement

**Installation steps:**
1. Position drawer-mount part on drawer side bottom edge
2. Flush with front of drawer face
3. Drill pilot holes
4. Drive screws to secure
5. Repeat for other side

**CRITICAL: Both drawer-mount parts must be exactly same distance from front**
- Measure from front of drawer to slide front
- Both sides identical or drawer won't close square

---

### Drawer Installation and Adjustment

**Installing drawer in cabinet:**
1. Extend cabinet slides fully
2. Tilt drawer box into cabinet at angle
3. Set drawer-mount parts onto cabinet slide rails
4. Push drawer back while lowering into position
5. Slide mechanism should click or engage
6. Test drawer operation (open/close several times)

**Common problems and fixes:**

**Drawer binds or sticks:**
- Check both slides at same height
- Verify drawer box is square
- Ensure drawer-mount parts aligned

**Drawer won't close:**
- Check for obstructions in cabinet
- Verify slide length adequate
- Ensure soft-close mechanism not over-engaged

**Drawer tilts or racks:**
- One slide mounted higher than other
- Re-measure and re-mount slides

**Soft-close doesn't engage:**
- Drawer not pushed fully closed
- Mechanism needs breaking in (open/close 10 times)
- Check mechanism not blocked

---

## Drawer Front Installation

### Applied Front Method (Recommended)

**What it is:**
Drawer box and drawer front are separate pieces. Front attaches to box after installation.

**Advantages:**
- Adjustable (perfect gap alignment)
- Front hides drawer box completely
- Professional appearance
- Easy to replace or update

**Drawer front dimensions:**
- Width: 30" (full opening width, may need trimming for perfect fit)
- Height: 10½" (covers 10" opening + ¼" overlap top and bottom)
- Material: ¾" plywood, finished to match cabinets

**Gap specifications:**
- 1/16" between drawer fronts (reveals)
- Consistent all around
- Even reveals = professional result

---

### Drawer Front Attachment

**Step 1: Cut and finish drawer fronts**
1. Cut three fronts to 30" × 10½"
2. Sand and finish to match cabinets (paint or stain)
3. Drill handle holes BEFORE attaching to drawer box
4. Easier to drill on bench than in cabinet

**Step 2: Position first drawer front (bottom drawer)**
1. Install drawer box in cabinet
2. Pull drawer out slightly
3. Place drawer front on drawer box
4. Use 1/16" spacer strips to position:
   - 1/16" below bottom of opening
   - 1/16" gap from cabinet sides
5. Front should overlap drawer box ½-¾" all around
6. Mark position lightly with pencil

**Step 3: Temporary attachment**
1. From inside drawer, drill two pilot holes through drawer box into front
2. Drive 1¼" screws from inside to temporarily hold front
3. Open drawer, check alignment
4. Adjust if needed

**Step 4: Permanent attachment**
1. Once aligned perfectly, add more screws (4-6 total)
2. Screws from inside drawer box into back of drawer front
3. Countersink screws so heads don't obstruct drawer contents
4. OR use drawer front adjustment brackets (available at hardware stores)

**Step 5: Repeat for middle and top drawers**
- Use bottom drawer front as reference
- 1/16" gap between each drawer
- Check reveals all around (should be consistent)

**Step 6: Install handles**
1. Measure handle position (typically centered horizontally)
2. Vertical position: centered or slightly high
3. Drill holes matched to handle screw spacing
4. Install handles from outside, screws into back

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Drawer box won't fit between slides

**Cause:** Drawer box too wide

**Fix:**
- Measure actual space between installed slides
- Sand or plane drawer sides until fits
- Should slide in with minimal friction

### Problem: Drawer front gaps uneven

**Cause:** Drawer front not aligned during attachment

**Fix:**
- Remove screws
- Reposition front using spacer strips
- Re-attach

### Problem: Drawer won't close completely

**Cause:** Drawer box hitting back of cabinet, or front hitting face frame

**Fix:**
- Check drawer depth vs. slide length
- Ensure slide fully extended into cabinet
- Trim drawer back if needed (rarely required)

### Problem: Soft-close too aggressive or not working

**Cause:** Mechanism needs adjustment or breaking in

**Fix:**
- Some slides have adjustment screw for soft-close tension
- Open/close 20 times to break in mechanism
- Check manufacturer instructions for adjustment

---

## Advanced Option: Dovetailed Drawers

**If you want heirloom quality and have time:**

**Dovetail advantages:**
- Strongest drawer joint
- Beautiful when exposed
- Traditional craftsmanship
- Adds value

**Dovetail requirements:**
- Dovetail jig ($100-300) OR hand-cut skills
- Router and dovetail bits ($40-60)
- Practice on scrap (expect failures)
- 2-3 hours per drawer (vs. 45 min with pocket holes)

**Recommendation for this project:**
- **Skip dovetails** for painted kitchen drawers
- Pocket holes adequate and much faster
- Save dovetail skills for future furniture project
- Focus effort on drawer operation and finish quality

## WS5 Hardware Integration Notes

**Cross-Reference:** See `docs/agent-outputs/ws5-doors-drawers/HARDWARE-RECOMMENDATION.md` for complete hardware specifications.

### Hardware Timing in Build Sequence

| Phase | Hardware Action | Why This Timing |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Before cabinet assembly | Order drawer slides online | 3-5 day shipping; slides must arrive before installation |
| After cabinet painting cures | Install cabinet-side slides | Paint must be hard enough to not mar |
| Before drawer installation | Install drawer-side slides | Can do on bench, easier than in cabinet |
| After drawer slides verified | Attach drawer fronts | Need working drawer to position front correctly |
| Last step | Install drawer pulls | Fronts must be attached first |

### Slide Mounting Clearance Verification

**BEFORE cutting drawer box parts, verify these measurements:**

1. **Cabinet interior width:** Measure actual interior (may vary from plan)
2. **Slide clearance needed:** Check slide specifications (typically 1/2" total, 1/4" per side)
3. **Drawer box width:** Interior width minus slide clearance

**Example calculation:**
- Cabinet interior: 30" (actual measured)
- Slide clearance: 0.5" (per manufacturer spec)
- Drawer box width: 30" - 0.5" = 29.5"

### Pre-Finishing Drawer Fronts

**Finish drawer fronts BEFORE attaching to boxes:**
- Easier to sand and paint on flat surface
- No masking of drawer box required
- Touch-ups possible before installation
- Drill handle holes BEFORE finishing (cleaner holes)

### Applied Front Adjustment Method

**For perfect drawer front alignment:**
1. Install drawer box on slides
2. Verify drawer operates smoothly
3. Cut 1/16" spacer strips
4. Position front on box face with spacers for consistent reveal
5. Tape front temporarily in position
6. From inside drawer, drive 2 screws through box into front
7. Remove tape, verify alignment
8. Add 4 more screws for permanent attachment
9. Remove spacers

**If alignment is wrong:** Remove screws, reposition, re-drill new holes

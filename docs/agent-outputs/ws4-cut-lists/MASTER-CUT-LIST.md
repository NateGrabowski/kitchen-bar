---

## Plywood Board Feet Calculation

### ¾" Plywood
- 4 sheets × 32 sq ft per sheet = 128 sq ft
- At ¾" thickness = 8 board feet per sheet
- Total: 32 board feet

### ½" Plywood
- 1 sheet × 32 sq ft = 32 sq ft
- At ½" thickness = 1.33 board feet per sheet
- Total: 1.33 board feet

### ¼" Plywood
- 1 sheet × 32 sq ft = 32 sq ft
- At ¼" thickness = 0.67 board feet per sheet
- Total: 0.67 board feet

**Total project board feet: ~34 board feet**

---

## Critical Cutting Notes

### Kerf Allowance
- Saw blade kerf: ⅛" (standard)
- When cutting multiple pieces from one strip, ADD ⅛" for each cut
- Example: Three 10" pieces from 30" strip = 30" - (2 × ⅛") = 29¾" usable

### Store vs. Home Cuts
**Have store rip (straight cuts, full length):**
- ¾" plywood to 14" width (cabinet depth) - 6+ strips
- ½" plywood to 10" width (drawer height) - 3 strips
- Large panel roughs (living room panel area, barn door area)

**Cut at home with miter saw:**
- All crosscuts under 12" (cabinet sides, drawer parts)
- Toe kick 2×4s
- All trim pieces

**Cut at home with circular saw + guide:**
- Large panels (living room panel 92" × 34.5")
- Barn door panel (30" × 35")
- Any cuts exceeding miter saw capacity

---

## Labeling System

**Use painter's tape + permanent marker:**
- Label immediately after cutting
- Mark BOTH the label AND the orientation
- Note good face vs. interior face
- Example: "A1 - Left Side - Good Face Out"

**Organize by assembly:**
- Stack Section 1 parts together
- Stack Section 2 parts together
- Stack Section 3 parts together
- Keep drawer parts separate
- Keep fronts/doors separate

---

## Quality Control Checkpoints

**After cutting each type:**
- [ ] All pieces same size are actually identical? (stack and verify)
- [ ] Edges clean and square? (no tearout on good faces)
- [ ] Labels applied and clear?
- [ ] Good faces marked correctly?
- [ ] Pieces organized by assembly?

**Before assembly:**
- [ ] Verify all pieces present (count against cut list)
- [ ] Test fit one cabinet dry (no glue)
- [ ] Measure diagonals (should be equal if square)

---

## Waste Calculation

**Plywood waste with efficient layout:**
- Expected usable material: ~85-90% per sheet
- Waste per sheet: 10-15% (~3-5 sq ft)
- Total waste: ~12-20 sq ft across all sheets

**Save large offcuts for:**
- Test cuts for dados, pocket holes
- Finish testing
- Practice pieces
- Potential repairs

**Small scraps can become:**
- Shims
- Blocking
- Drawer dividers
- Shelf supports

---

2. Verify dimensions against FINAL-DESIGN.md
3. Review plywood-layout.md for cutting sequence
4. Review shopping-list.md for material purchasing
5. Review cutting-sequence.md for order of operations

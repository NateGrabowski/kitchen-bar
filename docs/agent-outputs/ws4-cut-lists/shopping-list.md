# Shopping List - Kitchen Bar Cabinet

**Project:** Kitchen Bar Cabinet
**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Purpose:** Complete material shopping list organized by store with quantities and costs

---

## Shopping Strategy

**Recommended approach:**
1. Purchase all plywood and lumber from ONE big box store (Home Depot or Lowe's)
2. Have store make rip cuts while there
3. Purchase hardware separately (can order online or shop around)
4. Buy finishing supplies from paint store or big box

**Why one store for lumber:**
- Single trip
- Consistent plywood grade/color
- Can request cutting service
- Better bulk pricing sometimes

# Cutting Sequence - Kitchen Bar Cabinet

**Project:** Kitchen Bar Cabinet
**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Purpose:** Step-by-step cutting order to maximize efficiency and accuracy

---

## Overview

This document provides the EXACT ORDER to make cuts for optimal efficiency and safety.

**Key principles:**
1. **Store cuts first** (leverage professional equipment)
2. **Large pieces before small pieces** (easier to handle full sheets)
3. **Identical pieces together** (use stop blocks for consistency)
4. **Good face orientation matters** (prevent tearout on visible surfaces)
5. **Label immediately** (don't lose track of what's what)

**Estimated cutting time:** 8-10 hours over 1-2 days (including setup and labeling)

---

## Pre-Cutting Preparation (30 minutes)

### Before Any Cuts

**Workspace setup:**
- [ ] Clear minimum 4' × 8' flat area
- [ ] Set up two sawhorses with 2×4 on top (supports long cuts)
- [ ] Organize tools within reach (miter saw, circular saw, square, tape measure)
- [ ] Have labeling supplies ready (painter's tape, Sharpie markers)
- [ ] Set up shop vac or dust collection

**Tool preparation:**
- [ ] Install 60-tooth plywood blade in circular saw (fine finish, less tearout)
- [ ] Verify miter saw is square (test cut on scrap, measure 90°)
- [ ] Build or prepare straightedge guide for circular saw (see ADDENDUM-no-table-saw.md)
- [ ] Gather clamps (6-8 clamps minimum)
- [ ] Fresh pencil and marking knife

**Safety gear:**
- [ ] Safety glasses (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Hearing protection (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Dust mask (RECOMMENDED)
- [ ] Work gloves (for handling, remove when operating saws)

**Material prep:**
- [ ] Inspect all plywood sheets (check for damage, flatness)
- [ ] Note good face vs. rough face on each sheet
- [ ] Verify you have all materials from shopping list

---

## Phase 1: Big Box Store Cuts (At Store, 30 minutes)

### What to Have Store Cut

**Critical:** These cuts are FREE or ~$0.50 each and save you hours of work.

**¾" Plywood Sheet 1 - Cabinet box sheet:**
- [ ] Request three rip cuts at 14" width (creates three 14" × 96" strips)
- [ ] Tell them: "Three rips at 14 inches, full length"
- [ ] Verify cuts before leaving (should be within 1/16")

**½" Plywood Sheet - Drawer box sheet:**
- [ ] Request three rip cuts at 10" width (creates three 10" × 96" strips)
- [ ] Tell them: "Three rips at 10 inches, full length"
- [ ] Verify cuts before leaving

**Optional store cuts (saves time but not essential):**

**¾" Plywood Sheet 3 - Living room panel sheet:**
- [ ] Request one crosscut at 40" (separates living room panel section from toe kick section)
- [ ] Tell them: "One crosscut at 40 inches"

**¼" Plywood Sheet - Backs sheet:**
- [ ] Request rough cuts for three back panels if they have time
- [ ] Tell them: "Three rectangles approximately 30 by 35 inches"

**Store cutting cost: $3-7 total**

**After store cuts:**
- [ ] Load carefully (support full length, don't bend)
- [ ] Transport flat if possible
- [ ] Stack with good faces together (prevents scratching)

---

## Phase 2: Cabinet Side Pieces (1 hour)

**Tool:** Miter saw
**Material:** Three 14" × 96" strips of ¾" plywood (from store cuts)

### Why Cut These First
- Identical pieces (all 34.5" long)
- Miter saw gives cleanest, most accurate crosscuts
- Setting stop block ensures perfect consistency

---

### Step 1: Set Up Miter Saw for Repeated Cuts

**Stop block setup:**
1. [ ] Clamp stop block to miter saw fence at 34.5" from blade
2. [ ] Test cut on scrap piece
3. [ ] Measure test cut (should be exactly 34.5")
4. [ ] Adjust stop block if needed
5. [ ] Lock stop block in place

**Purpose:** All six cabinet sides will be IDENTICAL - critical for square cabinets

---

### Step 2: Cut Six Cabinet Sides (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2)

**Cutting process:**

**From first 14" × 96" strip:**
1. [ ] Position strip against fence and stop block
2. [ ] Let saw reach full speed
3. [ ] Make cut - **PIECE A1** (label immediately: "A1 - Left Side - Section 1")
4. [ ] Position strip for second cut
5. [ ] Make cut - **PIECE A2** (label immediately: "A2 - Right Side - Section 1")
6. [ ] Remaining piece ~27" long (save for tops/bottoms/shelves)

**From second 14" × 96" strip:**
1. [ ] Cut **PIECE B1** (34.5") - label: "B1 - Left Side - Section 2"
2. [ ] Cut **PIECE B2** (34.5") - label: "B2 - Right Side - Section 2"
3. [ ] Remaining piece ~27" long (save)

**From third 14" × 96" strip:**
1. [ ] Cut **PIECE C1** (34.5") - label: "C1 - Left Side - Section 3"
2. [ ] Cut **PIECE C2** (34.5") - label: "C2 - Right Side - Section 3"
3. [ ] Remaining piece ~27" long (save)

**Quality check after cutting all six sides:**
- [ ] Stack all six sides together - should be perfectly aligned
- [ ] Measure diagonals on each piece (should be equal - indicates squareness)
- [ ] Check for tearout on good faces (sand if minor)
- [ ] All labeled correctly with good face marked

**Save the three ~27" × 14" offcuts** - Will use for tops and bottoms

---

## Phase 3: Cabinet Tops and Bottoms (1 hour)

**Tool:** Miter saw
**Material:** Three ~27" × 14" offcuts from Phase 2, plus additional strips if needed

### Why Cut These Next
- Use offcuts efficiently (minimize waste)
- Similar to sides, but different widths per section

---

### Step 3A: Section 1 and 2 Tops/Bottoms (28.5" wide)

**Adjust stop block to 28.5"**

**From first offcut (~27" × 14"):**
- **PROBLEM:** Offcut only 27" but need 28.5"
- **SOLUTION:** Go back to original 14" × 96" strips (before you cut sides)

**Better approach: Cut from fresh 14" strip sections**

**From remaining sections of the three 14" × 96" strips:**
1. [ ] Adjust stop block to 28.5"
2. [ ] Cut **PIECE A3** - label: "A3 - Top - Section 1"
3. [ ] Cut **PIECE A4** - label: "A4 - Bottom - Section 1"
4. [ ] Cut **PIECE B3** - label: "B3 - Top - Section 2"
5. [ ] Cut **PIECE B4** - label: "B4 - Bottom - Section 2"

---

### Step 3B: Section 3 Top/Bottom (30.5" wide)

**Adjust stop block to 30.5"**

1. [ ] Cut **PIECE C3** - label: "C3 - Top - Section 3"
2. [ ] Cut **PIECE C4** - label: "C4 - Bottom - Section 3"

---

### Step 3C: Barn Door Section Shelves (28.5" × 13")

**Shelves are 13" deep (1" less than cabinet depth for clearance)**

**Option 1: Cut from 14" strips, then rip to 13"**
1. [ ] Cut two pieces at 28.5" from remaining 14" strip
2. [ ] Rip each piece to 13" depth with circular saw + guide
3. [ ] Label **B5** (Shelf 1) and **B6** (Shelf 2)

**Option 2: Cut from ¾" Sheet 2 or offcuts**
1. [ ] Find suitable offcut from Sheet 2
2. [ ] Mark two rectangles 28.5" × 13"
3. [ ] Cut with circular saw + guide
4. [ ] Label **B5** and **B6**

**Quality check:**
- [ ] All tops/bottoms correct dimensions
- [ ] Good faces marked (will be top surface, visible inside cabinet)
- [ ] Labeled clearly

---

## Phase 4: Drawer Box Parts from ½" Plywood (1.5 hours)

**Tool:** Miter saw
**Material:** Three 10" × 96" strips of ½" plywood (from store cuts)

### Why Cut These Next
- All drawer parts identical dimensions
- Perfect for stop block method
- Batch cutting saves time

---

### Step 4A: Drawer Fronts and Backs (29.5" × 10")

**Adjust stop block to 29.5"**

**From first 10" × 96" strip:**
1. [ ] Cut **D1-F** - label: "D1-F - Drawer 1 Front"
2. [ ] Cut **D1-B** - label: "D1-B - Drawer 1 Back"
3. [ ] Cut **D2-F** - label: "D2-F - Drawer 2 Front"

**From second 10" × 96" strip:**
1. [ ] Cut **D2-B** - label: "D2-B - Drawer 2 Back"
2. [ ] Cut **D3-F** - label: "D3-F - Drawer 3 Front"
3. [ ] Cut **D3-B** - label: "D3-B - Drawer 3 Back"

**Result:** 6 pieces at 29.5" × 10" (fronts and backs for 3 drawers)

---

### Step 4B: Drawer Sides (13" × 10")

**Adjust stop block to 13"**

**From third 10" × 96" strip:**
1. [ ] Cut **D1-L** - label: "D1-L - Drawer 1 Left Side"
2. [ ] Cut **D1-R** - label: "D1-R - Drawer 1 Right Side"
3. [ ] Cut **D2-L** - label: "D2-L - Drawer 2 Left Side"
4. [ ] Cut **D2-R** - label: "D2-R - Drawer 2 Right Side"
5. [ ] Cut **D3-L** - label: "D3-L - Drawer 3 Left Side"
6. [ ] Cut **D3-R** - label: "D3-R - Drawer 3 Right Side"

**Result:** 6 pieces at 13" × 10" (sides for 3 drawers)

**Quality check:**
- [ ] Stack all fronts/backs together - should be identical
- [ ] Stack all sides together - should be identical
- [ ] Organize by drawer (all D1 pieces together, etc.)

---

## Phase 5: Large Panels with Circular Saw (2 hours)

**Tool:** Circular saw with straightedge guide
**Material:** ¾" Plywood Sheet 3 (living room panel and toe kick)

### Why Cut These Now
- Require different tool (circular saw vs. miter saw)
- Large pieces need space and attention
- Most visible piece (living room panel) - take your time

---

### Step 5A: Living Room Panel (92" × 34.5")

**CRITICAL: This is the focal point piece. Take extra care.**

**Sheet orientation:**
- [ ] Place sheet GOOD FACE DOWN on sawhorses (tearout will be on back)
- [ ] Ensure full support across entire cut (prevent sagging/binding)

**Marking:**
1. [ ] Measure and mark 92" length
2. [ ] Measure and mark 34.5" width
3. [ ] Draw straight lines with straightedge
4. [ ] Score cut lines with utility knife (prevents tearout)

**Cutting sequence - Length first (92"):**
1. [ ] Clamp straightedge guide for 92" cut
2. [ ] Double-check measurement and guide alignment
3. [ ] Let saw reach full speed BEFORE entering cut
4. [ ] Make smooth, steady cut (don't force, let blade do the work)
5. [ ] Support offcut so it doesn't fall and splinter edge

**Cutting sequence - Width second (34.5"):**
1. [ ] Reposition piece on sawhorses
2. [ ] Clamp straightedge guide for 34.5" cut
3. [ ] Score cut line again
4. [ ] Make cut with same care as length cut

**Label immediately:**
- [ ] Mark GOOD FACE clearly
- [ ] Label: "LRP - Living Room Panel - GOOD FACE TO LIVING ROOM"
- [ ] Handle carefully (this is a large, unwieldy piece)

**Quality check:**
- [ ] Measure all four sides (should be exactly 92" × 34.5")
- [ ] Measure diagonals (should be equal within 1/16" - indicates square)
- [ ] Check good face for tearout (should be minimal)
- [ ] Edges clean and straight

---

### Step 5B: Toe Kick Platform Top (92" × 14")

**From remaining Sheet 3 material:**

**Option 1: Cut from same sheet after removing living room panel**
1. [ ] From remaining piece (should be ~92" × 13.5" after living room panel removed)
2. [ ] Mark 92" × 14" rectangle
3. [ ] Cut with circular saw + guide
4. [ ] Face orientation less critical (will be hidden under cabinet)

**Option 2: Cut from offcuts or scrap**
- [ ] If large offcuts available, piece together with pocket screws
- [ ] Or purchase separate piece from store

**Label:**
- [ ] "TK-TOP - Toe Kick Platform Top"

---

## Phase 6: Barn Door and Additional Panels (1.5 hours)

**Tool:** Circular saw with straightedge guide
**Material:** ¾" Plywood Sheet 2

### Step 6A: Barn Door Panel (30" × 35")

**CRITICAL: Must be square for smooth sliding operation**

**From Sheet 2:**
1. [ ] Mark 30" × 35" rectangle on sheet
2. [ ] Place GOOD FACE DOWN (tearout on back)
3. [ ] Score cut lines with utility knife
4. [ ] Clamp straightedge guide
5. [ ] Cut width (30") first
6. [ ] Cut height (35") second

**Verify squareness:**
- [ ] Measure diagonals (MUST be equal - door won't slide smoothly if not square)
- [ ] Measure all four corners with speed square (should be 90°)
- [ ] If not square, trim to correct

**Label:**
- [ ] "BD - Barn Door Panel - GOOD FACE OUT"

---

### Step 6B: Drawer Fronts (30" × 10.5")

**From remaining Sheet 2:**

**Option 1: Rip 10.5" strip, then crosscut**
1. [ ] Rip 10.5" wide strip with circular saw + guide (full length ~96")
2. [ ] Crosscut three pieces at 30" with miter saw
3. [ ] Label **DF1, DF2, DF3**

**Option 2: Cut individual pieces with circular saw**
1. [ ] Mark three rectangles 30" × 10.5"
2. [ ] Cut each with circular saw + guide
3. [ ] Label **DF1, DF2, DF3**

**Quality check:**
- [ ] All three drawer fronts identical size
- [ ] Good faces marked (will be visible drawer faces)

---

### Step 6C: Cabinet Door Fronts (15⅝" × 33")

**From remaining Sheet 2:**

1. [ ] Mark two rectangles 15⅝" × 33"
2. [ ] Cut with circular saw + guide OR miter saw if it reaches
3. [ ] Good face orientation (both sides will be visible)
4. [ ] Label **DOOR-L** and **DOOR-R**

**Alternative: Cut from separate piece if Sheet 2 too consumed**
- Can cut from Sheet 1 offcuts if large enough pieces remain

---

## Phase 7: Cabinet Backs (¼" Plywood) (45 minutes)

**Tool:** Circular saw with guide OR miter saw if pieces fit
**Material:** ¼" Plywood Sheet

### Step 7: Cut Three Back Panels

**From ¼" sheet:**

**Option 1: Store already rough-cut these (if you requested at store)**
1. [ ] Trim to final dimensions: 30" × 34.5", 30" × 34.5", 32" × 34.5"
2. [ ] Use miter saw or circular saw for trim cuts

**Option 2: Cut from full sheet at home**
1. [ ] Mark three rectangles:
   - **A5:** 30" × 34.5" (label: "A5 - Back Panel - Section 1")
   - **B7:** 30" × 34.5" (label: "B7 - Back Panel - Section 2")
   - **C5:** 32" × 34.5" (label: "C5 - Back Panel - Section 3")
2. [ ] Cut with circular saw + guide
3. [ ] Face orientation doesn't matter (one side faces out, one side faces cabinet interior)

**Note:** ¼" plywood is flimsy - support well during cutting to prevent flexing

---

## Phase 8: Drawer Bottoms (¼" Plywood) (30 minutes)

**Tool:** Circular saw or miter saw
**Material:** Remaining ¼" plywood

### Step 8: Cut Three Drawer Bottoms

**From remaining ¼" sheet:**

1. [ ] Mark three rectangles 29" × 12.5"
2. [ ] Cut with circular saw + guide OR miter saw
3. [ ] Label:
   - **D1-BTM:** "D1-BTM - Drawer 1 Bottom"
   - **D2-BTM:** "D2-BTM - Drawer 2 Bottom"
   - **D3-BTM:** "D3-BTM - Drawer 3 Bottom"

**If using dado method:**
- Bottoms sit in grooves, slight undersize OK (helps assembly)

**If using pocket screw method for bottoms:**
- Can cut from ½" plywood instead at 29.5" × 13" (full size)

---

## Phase 8B: Wire Routing Holes (Per WS7) (30 minutes)

**Tool:** Drill with Forstner bits or hole saw
**Material:** Cabinet side panels (A1, A2/B1, B2)

### Why Drill These Now
- MUCH easier to drill before assembly
- Clean, accurate holes when piece is flat on sawhorses
- Required for electrical integration per WS7 ELECTRICAL-PLAN.md

---

### Step 8B-1: Drill Holes in A1 (Left Side Panel - Section 1)

**Drill bits needed:** 1" Forstner, ½" Forstner

**Hole H1 - 120V Entry:**
1. [ ] Lay A1 flat on sawhorses
2. [ ] Measure and mark: 6" from bottom edge, 7" from back edge
3. [ ] Use 1" Forstner bit
4. [ ] Drill from INTERIOR face (cleaner exit on visible side)
5. [ ] Sand edges of hole smooth

**Hole H2 - LED Wire Entry:**
1. [ ] Measure and mark: 4" from bottom edge, 7" from back edge (near H1)
2. [ ] Use ½" Forstner bit
3. [ ] Drill from INTERIOR face
4. [ ] Sand edges smooth

**Quality check:**
- [ ] Holes are clean with minimal tearout
- [ ] Holes are in correct location (interior of cabinet)

---

### Step 8B-2: Drill Hole in A2/B1 (Divider Panel)

**Note:** A2 (Section 1 right) and B1 (Section 2 left) may be the same panel if building unified cabinet.

**Drill bit needed:** ¾" Forstner

**Hole H5 - Zone 2 LED Pass-Through:**
1. [ ] Lay divider panel flat
2. [ ] Measure and mark: 6" from bottom edge, centered on depth
3. [ ] Use ¾" Forstner bit
4. [ ] Drill cleanly through

**Quality check:**
- [ ] Hole is centered on panel depth
- [ ] Edges are smooth

---

### Step 8B-3: Mark Hole Locations for Later (During Assembly)

These holes are easier to drill during or after assembly:

**Hole H4 - Cabinet Top (A3):**
- [ ] Mark location: Near left edge, 2" from back
- [ ] Size: ¼" diameter
- [ ] Drill during/after assembly with ¼" bit

**Hole H6 - Section 2 Right Side (B2):**
- [ ] Mark TWO locations near shelves
- [ ] Size: ¼" diameter each
- [ ] Drill during/after assembly

**Hole H3 - Countertop:**
- [ ] 3¾" diameter for pop-up outlet
- [ ] CUT AFTER CABINET IS INSTALLED (location depends on final positioning)

---

### Step 8B-4: Install Grommets

**After drilling H1, H2, and H5:**
1. [ ] Insert 1" grommet into H1
2. [ ] Insert ½" grommet into H2
3. [ ] Insert ¾" grommet into H5
4. [ ] Press or tap gently until snug

**Note:** ¼" grommets (for H4, H6) installed during/after assembly

---

### Step 8B-5: Cut Foot Rail Backing Blocks

**From 2×4 scraps (cut during toe kick frame phase):**

1. [ ] Cut three blocks at 3.5" × 3.5" (using remaining 2×4 after cross supports)
2. [ ] Label **FR-BLK1, FR-BLK2, FR-BLK3**
3. [ ] Note mounting positions:
   - FR-BLK1: 3" from left end
   - FR-BLK2: 46" from left end (center)
   - FR-BLK3: 89" from left end

**These blocks install inside toe kick cavity during assembly.**

---

## Phase 9: Dimensional Lumber (Toe Kick and Trim) (1.5 hours)

**Tool:** Miter saw
**Material:** 2×4s and 1×4s/1×6s

### Step 9A: Toe Kick Frame (2×4 Lumber)

**From three 8-foot 2×4s:**

**Two long rails:**
1. [ ] Cut **TK-F** at 92" (front rail)
2. [ ] Cut **TK-B** at 92" (back rail)

**Six cross supports:**
1. [ ] Set stop block at 11"
2. [ ] Cut **TK-C1** through **TK-C6** (six pieces at 11")

**Label all pieces:**
- Mark which is front, which is back
- Number cross supports 1-6

---

### Step 9B: Barn Door Trim (1×4 Lumber)

**For X-frame perimeter:**

**From 1×4 boards:**

**Note:** Final trim lengths determined during door assembly - cut rough now, final fit later

**Rough cuts (will trim to fit during assembly):**
1. [ ] Top frame: 32" (cut to 30" when fitting)
2. [ ] Bottom frame: 32" (cut to 30" when fitting)
3. [ ] Left frame: 37" (cut to 35" when fitting)
4. [ ] Right frame: 37" (cut to 35" when fitting)
5. [ ] Diagonal 1: 44" (cut to fit in place)
6. [ ] Diagonal 2: 44" (cut to fit in place)

**Why rough cut?**
- Miters and angles determined during assembly
- Easier to cut 1" too long and trim than 1" too short

**Label:**
- Mark which pieces are for barn door
- "BD-T, BD-B, BD-L, BD-R, BD-X1, BD-X2" (rough cuts)

---

### Step 9C: Living Room Panel Trim (1×6 and 1×4) - OPTIONAL

**If adding X-frame to living room panel:**

**Perimeter frame (1×6):**
- [ ] Top: 94" (rough - trim to 92" with miters)
- [ ] Bottom: 94" (rough - trim to 92" with miters)
- [ ] Left: 37" (rough - trim to 34.5" with miters)
- [ ] Right: 37" (rough - trim to 34.5" with miters)

**Vertical dividers (1×4):**
- [ ] Two pieces at 36" (rough - trim to ~31" between top/bottom frames)

**X-diagonals (1×4):**
- [ ] Six pieces at 44" (rough - cut to fit during assembly)

**Note:** All trim final-fit during assembly phase, not now

---

## Phase 10: Organize and Verify (30 minutes)

### Step 10: Organization Before Assembly

**Organize parts by section:**

**Section 1 (Drawer Cabinet) Stack:**
- [ ] A1, A2 (sides)
- [ ] A3, A4 (top, bottom)
- [ ] A5 (back)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Not Using Stop Block
**Problem:** Pieces supposed to be identical come out different sizes
**Solution:** ALWAYS use stop block for repeated cuts

### Mistake 2: Wrong Face Orientation
**Problem:** Tearout on visible side from circular saw
**Solution:** GOOD FACE DOWN when using circular saw

### Mistake 3: Cutting Too Fast
**Problem:** Blade binds, kickback, rough cuts
**Solution:** Let blade do the work, smooth steady pressure

### Mistake 4: Poor Support
**Problem:** Piece sags during cut, binds blade, dangerous
**Solution:** Support on BOTH sides of cut, use sawhorses

### Mistake 5: Not Labeling Immediately
**Problem:** Lose track of what piece is what
**Solution:** Label with painter's tape and Sharpie RIGHT AFTER cutting

### Mistake 6: Forgetting Kerf
**Problem:** Multiple pieces from one strip come out short
**Solution:** Remember ⅛" kerf per cut, account for it in layout

### Mistake 7: Not Verifying Squareness
**Problem:** Cabinet boxes won't assemble square
**Solution:** Check diagonals on every critical piece (living room panel, barn door, large pieces)

---

## Safety Reminders

### Never Do These Things

❌ Cut without safety glasses
❌ Reach over or behind blade
❌ Remove blade guard (keep it on)
❌ Cut freehand (always use fence or guide)
❌ Force the blade through cut (causes kickback)
❌ Stand directly behind circular saw (kickback zone)
❌ Cut while distracted or tired

### Always Do These Things

✅ Wear safety glasses and hearing protection
✅ Let blade reach full speed before entering cut
✅ Support piece on both sides of cut
✅ Use sharp blades (dull blades dangerous and make rough cuts)
✅ Keep hands 6" away from blade path
✅ Unplug saw when changing blades
✅ Clean up sawdust regularly (slipping hazard)

## Next Steps After Cutting

1. **Rest** - Cutting is physically demanding, take a break
2. **Review build sequence** - See BUILD-SEQUENCE-v2.md for assembly order
3. **Sand interior faces** - Easier before assembly (see Phase 8 in build sequence)
4. **Drill pocket holes** - See Step 6 in build sequence
5. **Cut dados if using** - See Step 7 in build sequence
6. **Begin assembly** - Start with toe kick platform

**Congratulations! Cutting complete - you're ready to build!**

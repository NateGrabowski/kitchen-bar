## No-Table-Saw Approach

**This cut list is optimized for builders WITHOUT a table saw.**

**Cutting methods:**
1. **Store rip cuts:** Long, straight rips of full sheets (¾" to 14" strips, ½" to 10" strips)
2. **Miter saw:** All crosscuts up to 12" (cabinet parts, drawer parts, trim)
3. **Circular saw + guide:** Large panels and long cuts (living room panel, barn door)

**Store cutting service cost: $5-7**
**Time saved: 2-3 hours of setup and ripping**

See `docs/agent-outputs/ws3-construction/ADDENDUM-no-table-saw.md` for full details.

## Using These Documents

### For Shopping

1. Read `shopping-list.md` completely
2. Choose budget vs. standard vs. premium options
3. Decide on single trip vs. phased shopping
4. Print checklist section
5. Visit stores and purchase materials
6. Have store make rip cuts (bring dimensions)

**Pro tip:** Bring cut list printout to store cutting desk

---

### For Cutting

1. Read `cutting-sequence.md` completely BEFORE starting
2. Set up workspace and tools (Phase 0 checklist)
3. Have store make initial rip cuts (Phase 1)
4. Follow phases 2-11 in exact order
5. Label each piece immediately after cutting
6. Verify against `MASTER-CUT-LIST.md` when complete

**Pro tip:** Take breaks between phases - cutting is tiring

---

### During Assembly

1. Reference `MASTER-CUT-LIST.md` for piece identification
2. Check `plywood-layout.md` if unsure which piece is which
3. Good face orientation marked on each piece
4. Organize pieces by section (A, B, C) for efficiency

---

## Notes for Builder

### Before You Start

- [ ] Read all four files completely (don't skip ahead)
- [ ] Verify you have all tools listed in cutting-sequence.md
- [ ] Check for plywood sales (can save $50-100)
- [ ] Arrange truck or delivery for plywood transport
- [ ] Clear workspace for cutting and organizing parts

### Pro Tips

1. **Label obsessively** - You'll have 50+ pieces of plywood, labeling prevents mistakes
2. **Use stop blocks** - Ensures identical pieces are truly identical
3. **Good face DOWN** - When using circular saw (prevents tearout on visible side)
4. **Store cuts are worth it** - $5 to save 2-3 hours of ripping? Yes please.
5. **Save large offcuts** - Great for testing dados, pocket holes, finish

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I use different plywood grades?**
A: Yes, but keep consistent within each section. Birch, maple, or quality pine all work for paint-grade.

**Q: Can I substitute materials?**
A: Plywood thicknesses are critical (¾", ½", ¼"). Lumber species flexible (pine vs. poplar OK).

**Q: What if store cuts are off?**
A: Verify before leaving store. If off by more than 1/16", request re-cut. Most stores will redo for free.

**Q: Can I cut everything with just miter saw?**
A: No - large panels (living room panel 92"×34.5") require circular saw. Miter saw only cuts ~12" wide.

**Q: Do I need all the trim?**
A: Barn door trim is required. Living room X-frame is optional but recommended (focal point).

### 2. Store Rip Request

When purchasing plywood, request these rips at the store cutting station:

**3/4" Plywood (4 sheets):**
- Sheet 1: Rip to 14" width (2 rips = 14", 14", 14", 6" scrap)
- Sheet 2: Rip to 14" width (same)
- Sheet 3: Rip to 14" width + 10-1/2" width for drawer fronts
- Sheet 4: Rip to 35" width for barn door + 35" for living room panel

**1/2" Plywood (1 sheet):**
- Rip to 10" width (4 rips = 10", 10", 10", 10", 8" scrap)

**1/4" Plywood (1 sheet):**
- Rip to 12-1/2" width for drawer bottoms
- Rip to 34-1/2" width for cabinet backs

### 3. Organize Workspace

## Cutting Sequence

### Day 1: Store Cuts and Setup

**At the store:**
1. Have all plywood ripped to specified widths (see Pre-Build Preparation)
2. Load strips carefully - avoid bending or flexing

**At home:**
1. Unload and stack plywood with spacers
2. Label each strip with painter's tape: "3/4 - 14" CABINET" etc.
3. Let acclimate overnight

### Day 2: Crosscuts - Cabinet Boxes

**Miter saw setup:**
- Install stop block at 34-1/2" for cabinet sides
- Cut all 6 cabinet sides (A1, A2, B2, C1, C2, plus one spare)

**Adjust stop block to 28-1/2":**
- Cut 4 pieces for Section 1 and 2 tops/bottoms
- Cut 2 shelves at 28-1/2" x 13" (rip first if needed)

**Adjust stop block to 30-1/2":**
- Cut 2 pieces for Section 3 top/bottom

**Label each piece immediately with painter's tape!**

### Day 3: Crosscuts - Drawers and Fronts

**Miter saw - drawer box parts (1/2" strips):**
- Set stop block to 29-1/2"
- Cut 6 pieces (3 fronts, 3 backs)

- Cut 3 drawer fronts

**1/4" plywood for drawer bottoms:**
- Circular saw + guide: Cut 3 pieces at 29" x 12-1/2"

### Day 4: Large Panels

**Circular saw with straightedge guide:**

**Barn door panel:**
1. Mark 30" x 35" rectangle on 3/4" plywood
2. Clamp straightedge parallel to cut line
3. Cut with good face DOWN (reduces tearout)
4. Measure diagonals - must be equal (square)

**Living room panel:**
1. Mark 92" x 34-1/2" rectangle
2. This is your largest and most visible piece - take your time
3. Cut with good face DOWN
4. Measure diagonals - adjust if not square

**1/4" cabinet backs:**
1. Cut 3 pieces: 30" x 34-1/2" (2) and 32" x 34-1/2" (1)

### Day 5: Toe Kick and Trim

|------|----------|------|---------|
| H1 | A1 (left side), 6" from bottom | 1" dia | 120V Romex entry |
| H2 | A1 (left side), 4" from bottom | 1/2" dia | LED wire entry |
| H3 | A2/B1 divider, 6" from bottom | 3/4" dia | Wire pass-through |
| H4 | Cabinet top, as needed | 1/4" dia | LED wire drops |

**Use Forstner bits for clean holes. Install grommets in all holes.**

---

## Quality Checkpoint: Cut List Verification

Before proceeding to assembly, verify:

- [ ] All pieces cut to exact dimensions (measure twice!)
- [ ] All pieces labeled clearly (painter's tape + marker)
- [ ] Cabinet sides identical (stack and verify edges align)
- [ ] Drawer parts identical (all fronts same, all backs same, etc.)

## Key Formulas

**Cabinet interior width:**
```
Exterior width - (2 x 3/4") = Interior width
30" - 1.5" = 28.5"
32" - 1.5" = 30.5"
```

**Drawer box width:**
```
Cabinet interior - Slide clearance = Drawer width
28.5" - 0.5" = 28" (approx 29.5" actual per design)
```

**Diagonal check (for square):**
```
If diagonal A = diagonal B, box is square
Tolerance: +/- 1/16"
```

# Chapter 5B: Living Room Panel Construction & Installation

**Purpose:** This chapter covers the construction and installation of the Living Room Panel - a major 92" x 34-1/2" structural element that finishes the living room side of the cabinet and supports the barn door track.

**Position in Build Sequence:** Complete this AFTER cabinet box assembly (Chapter 5) and BEFORE barn door installation (Chapter 7).

## Overview

### What Is the Living Room Panel?

The Living Room Panel is the full-width face of the cabinet that faces your living room. It serves three critical functions:

1. **Structural:** Creates a rigid mounting surface for the barn door track
2. **Aesthetic:** Presents a finished, decorative face to the living room
3. **Concealing:** Hides the backs of the three cabinet boxes from view

### Panel Specifications

| Specification | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| **Width** | 92" (full cabinet length) |
| **Height** | 34-1/2" (cabinet body height) |
| **Thickness** | 3/4" plywood + 3/4" trim = 1-1/2" total |
| **Material** | Cabinet-grade birch plywood |
| **Surface** | Three-section X-frame overlay |
| **Finish** | Painted to match cabinet (Hale Navy HC-154) |

### Why This Panel Is Critical

**Without the Living Room Panel:**
- Barn door track has nothing to mount to
- Living room sees exposed cabinet backs
- No surface for decorative X-frame design
- Cabinet lacks visual weight from living room

**With the Living Room Panel:**
- Solid mounting for barn door track (supports 50+ lb door)
- Professional finished appearance
- Coordinates X-frame with barn door design
- Creates focal point for living room

## Part 1: Panel Construction

### Step 1: Cut the Plywood Panel

**Critical Measurements:**
- Width: 92" (must match cabinet length exactly)
- Height: 34-1/2" (matches cabinet body height)

**Cutting Process:**

1. Mark 92" x 34-1/2" rectangle on 3/4" plywood
2. Clamp straightedge guide parallel to cut line
3. Cut with circular saw, **good face DOWN** (reduces tearout)
4. Make all four cuts
5. Measure diagonals to verify square:
   - Both diagonals must be equal within 1/8"
   - If not equal, trim to square

**Quality Check:**
- [ ] Dimensions exactly 92" x 34-1/2"
- [ ] Panel is flat (no twist or bow)
- [ ] Good face is clean and undamaged
- [ ] Edges are clean and straight
- [ ] Diagonals are equal (panel is square)

### Step 2: Prepare the Panel Surface

1. Sand good face (will be visible) with 120 grit
2. Progress to 150 grit, then 220 grit
3. Sand back face lightly (will face cabinets)
4. Ease all edges with sandpaper (prevents paint peeling)
5. Vacuum all dust
6. Wipe with tack cloth

**Mark the panel:**
- Mark "OUT" on visible face
- Mark "UP" at top edge
- Mark "LEFT" at left edge (from living room view)

### Step 3: Prime the Panel (Do This NOW)

Priming before trim installation ensures complete coverage:

1. Apply shellac-based primer (Zinsser B-I-N) to:
   - Entire front face
   - All four edges
   - Back face (prevents moisture-related warping)
2. Let dry 45 minutes
3. Light sand with 320 grit on front face only
4. Tack cloth to remove dust

---

## Part 2: X-Frame Construction

The X-frame transforms a plain panel into a modern farmhouse focal point. This design creates three equal sections with X-patterns inside each section.

### Design Layout

           (30" cabinet)   (30" cabinet)   (32" cabinet)
```

### Step 4: Cut Perimeter Frame Pieces (1x6)

**Mark the interior space:**
With 5-1/2" frame on all sides, interior is:
- Interior width: 92" - (2 x 5.5") = 81"
- Interior height: 34.5" - (2 x 5.5") = 23.5"

**Cut frame pieces (all with 45-degree miters):**

| Piece | Length (long point to long point) | Miter |
|-------|----------------------------------|-------|
| Top frame | 92" | 45 degrees, both ends |
| Bottom frame | 92" | 45 degrees, both ends |
| Left frame | 34-1/2" | 45 degrees, both ends |
| Right frame | 34-1/2" | 45 degrees, both ends |

**Miter cutting tips:**
1. Set miter saw to 45 degrees
2. Cut one end first
3. Measure from long point
4. Cut second end (miters face OUTWARD for frame corners)
5. Test fit - miters should meet cleanly at corners

### Step 5: Cut Vertical Dividers (1x4)

**Divider positions:**
- Divider 1: 30.67" from left interior edge (after frame)
- Divider 2: 61.33" from left interior edge

**Cut pieces:**

| Piece | Length | End Cuts |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Divider 1 | 23-1/2" | Square cuts (fits between top and bottom frame) |
| Divider 2 | 23-1/2" | Square cuts |

### Step 6: Cut X-Diagonal Pieces (1x4)

**Each section interior after frame:**
- Width: 27" (81" / 3)
- Height: 23-1/2"

**Calculate diagonal length:**
```
Diagonal = sqrt(27^2 + 23.5^2) = sqrt(729 + 552.25) = sqrt(1281.25) = 35.8"
```
Round up to 36" and cut to fit.

**Cut 6 diagonal pieces:**
- 6 pieces at approximately 36-38" (trim to fit during installation)
- DO NOT cut angle cuts yet - mark and cut during assembly

### Step 7: Assemble Perimeter Frame to Panel

**Assembly sequence:**

1. **Position panel** face-up on sawhorses
2. **Dry fit** perimeter frame around panel edges
3. Verify:
   - Frame edges align with panel edges
   - Mitered corners meet cleanly
   - No gaps between frame and panel

**Attach perimeter frame:**

1. Apply wood glue to back of TOP frame piece
2. Position on panel, flush with top and side edges
3. Brad nail every 6-8" through frame into panel
4. Apply clamp pressure to mitered corners

5. Apply wood glue to back of BOTTOM frame piece
6. Position flush with bottom and side edges
7. Brad nail every 6-8"

8. Apply wood glue to LEFT frame piece
9. Position flush with left edge
10. Brad nail every 6-8"
11. Nail into mitered joint with top and bottom frame

12. Apply wood glue to RIGHT frame piece
13. Position flush with right edge
14. Brad nail every 6-8"
15. Nail into mitered joints

**Quality Check:**
- [ ] All frame pieces flush with panel edges
- [ ] Mitered corners tight (less than 1/32" gap)
- [ ] Frame firmly attached (no flex)
- [ ] Wipe excess glue immediately

### Step 8: Install Vertical Dividers

1. Mark divider positions on interior of frame:
   - Divider 1: 27" from left interior edge
   - Divider 2: 54" from left interior edge (27" + 27")

2. Apply wood glue to back of first divider
3. Position between top and bottom frame pieces
4. Verify vertical with level
5. Brad nail through divider into panel (every 6")
6. Nail ends into top and bottom frame pieces

7. Repeat for second divider

**Quality Check:**
- [ ] Dividers are perfectly vertical (use level)
- [ ] Creates three equal-width sections
- [ ] Dividers are firmly attached

### Step 9: Install X-Diagonals

This is the most detailed step. Take your time.

**For EACH section (repeat 3 times):**

**Measure actual dimensions:**
1. Measure actual interior width of section (should be ~27")
2. Measure actual interior height (should be ~23-1/2")
3. These may vary slightly - always measure, don't assume

**Cut and install first diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):**

1. Hold 1x4 stock diagonally across section
2. Mark where it meets the frame and divider
3. Mark the CUT ANGLE on the wood
4. Cut angles on miter saw (approximately 40-41 degrees)
5. Test fit - should fit corner to corner
6. Trim if needed
7. Apply glue to back
8. Position and brad nail every 8-10"

**Cut and install second diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):**

1. This diagonal crosses OVER the first (decide which is on top at center)
2. Repeat measurement and cutting process
3. Apply glue to back
4. Position over first diagonal
5. Brad nail every 8-10"
6. At crossing point, nail through both pieces into panel

**Critical Tips:**
- Work one section at a time
- Number each piece (S1-D1, S1-D2, S2-D1, etc.)
- The crossing point should be at CENTER of each section
- Consistent overlap pattern at all three crossings

### Step 10: Fill and Finish X-Frame

1. Fill all nail holes with wood filler
2. Let dry per manufacturer instructions
3. Sand filler flush with 220 grit
4. Inspect for gaps between trim and panel
5. Fill gaps with paintable caulk if present
6. Sand entire assembly lightly with 220 grit
7. Vacuum and tack cloth

## Part 3: Panel Installation

### When to Install

**Install the Living Room Panel:**
- AFTER all three cabinet boxes are assembled
- AFTER cabinet boxes are joined together (or during joining)
- BEFORE installing barn door track
- BEFORE final painting (or after - see finishing options)

**Two installation approaches:**

| Approach | When | Advantage |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **A: Before paint** | During assembly | Easier to reach all surfaces |
| **B: After paint** | During finishing | No masking needed, cleaner look |

**RECOMMENDED: Approach A** - Install panel, then paint everything at once

### Step 11: Prepare Cabinet Backs for Panel

The Living Room Panel attaches to the BACK face of all three cabinet boxes.

**Verify cabinet alignment:**
1. Ensure all three cabinet backs are flush with each other
2. No cabinet should be proud (sticking out past others)
3. Adjust cabinet positions if needed

**Mark attachment points:**

On the cabinet backs (viewing from living room side):
1. Mark horizontal lines at 4" from top and 4" from bottom
2. Mark vertical lines at every 16" across the 92" width
3. These are your screw locations (approximately 12 screws)

### Step 12: Drill Pocket Holes in Panel

**Pocket hole placement:**

Using Kreg jig set for 3/4" material:
1. Drill pocket holes on the BACK face of panel (faces cabinets)
2. Position holes at marked locations (4" from top/bottom, 16" spacing)
3. Approximately 12 pocket holes minimum

**Alternative: Through-screw from cabinet side**
If preferred, you can screw through cabinet backs INTO the panel:
1. Pre-drill clearance holes in cabinet backs
2. Drive screws from inside cabinet into panel

### Step 13: Position and Align Panel

**You will need a helper for this step** - the panel is 92" long and awkward to position alone.

1. Stand panel against cabinet backs (X-frame facing out to living room)
2. Align top of panel with top of cabinet boxes
3. Align bottom of panel with bottom of cabinet boxes
4. Verify left and right edges align with cabinet ends

**Check alignment at multiple points:**
- Top left corner
- Top right corner
- Bottom left corner
- Bottom right corner
- Center

**Gap Check:**
- Panel should sit flat against cabinet backs
- No gaps larger than 1/8"
- Use shims behind panel if cabinet backs are uneven

### Step 14: Secure Panel to Cabinet

**If using pocket holes (RECOMMENDED):**

1. Clamp panel to cabinets at multiple points
2. From BEHIND the panel (inside cabinet area), verify alignment
3. Drive 1-1/4" pocket screws through pocket holes into cabinet backs
4. Work from center outward
5. Check alignment after every 2-3 screws
6. Remove clamps once all screws are installed

**If using through-screws:**

1. Clamp panel to cabinets
2. From INSIDE each cabinet, drive screws through cabinet back into panel
3. Use 1-1/4" screws (3/4" cabinet back + 3/4" into panel = don't break through)
4. Pre-drill to prevent splitting

**Optional: Apply construction adhesive**

For extra bond strength (especially important for barn door track loading):
1. Before final positioning, apply bead of construction adhesive to cabinet backs
2. Position panel
3. Clamp and screw as above
4. Let adhesive cure 24 hours before installing barn door track

### Step 15: Verify Installation

**Critical Quality Checks:**

- [ ] Panel is plumb (vertical) - check with level
- [ ] Panel is flush with cabinet tops
- [ ] Panel is flush with cabinet bottoms
- [ ] No gaps between panel and cabinet backs
- [ ] All pocket screws are tight
- [ ] Panel does not flex when pressed
- [ ] X-frame faces living room
- [ ] No visible fasteners from living room side

## Part 4: Finishing the Panel

### Finishing Options

**Option A: Paint Entire Panel (RECOMMENDED)**
- X-frame and backing painted same color (Hale Navy)
- Matches cabinet boxes
- Creates unified, cohesive look
- Easier to touch up

**Option B: Contrast Finish**
- Backing painted (Hale Navy)
- X-frame trim stained natural wood
- Creates visual interest
- More complex finishing process
- Matches barn door X-frame (if staining that)

### Step 16: Final Paint Preparation

If panel was primed before assembly:
1. Light sand entire X-frame assembly with 320 grit
2. Sand into corners and crevices
3. Vacuum all dust
4. Tack cloth entire surface

If panel was NOT primed:
1. Vacuum all dust from assembly
2. Tack cloth
3. Apply shellac primer to entire panel
4. Let dry 45 minutes
5. Sand with 320 grit
6. Tack cloth again

### Step 17: Apply Paint

**Materials:**
- Benjamin Moore Advance Satin in Hale Navy (HC-154)
- Quality angled brush (2-1/2")
- Foam mini roller

**Application:**

1. Cut in all edges, corners, and X-frame details with brush
2. While still wet, roll flat areas of backing panel
3. Brush into X-frame intersections
4. Tip off with brush in direction of wood grain
5. Let dry 16 hours

**Second coat:**
1. Light sand with 320 grit
2. Tack cloth
3. Repeat application process
4. Let dry 24-48 hours before handling

**Full cure: 7-14 days**

## Part 5: Barn Door Track Preparation

The Living Room Panel is specifically designed to support the barn door track. Proper positioning is critical.

### Track Mounting Location

**Horizontal Position:**
```
|<----------- 92" ----------->|
|                              |
|     |<-- Track (60") -->|    |
|     ^                        |
|     |                        |
|     30" from left edge       |
|                              |
```

The barn door slides LEFT to open. Track must extend far enough left to fully clear the opening.

**Track start:** 30" from right edge (leaves room to slide door right when closing)
**Track end:** 90" from right edge (clears 30" opening when door slides left)
**Track center:** ~60" from left edge

**Vertical Position:**

| Measurement | Value | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Track position | 36-1/2" from cabinet bottom | 2" above cabinet top |
| Door clearance | 1/2" above panel top | Door should not drag on top |

### Step 18: Mark Track Position

1. Measure up 36-1/2" from cabinet bottom (which is 2" above cabinet top/35" panel height)
   - Note: Track mounts slightly above the panel top, into the countertop overhang area
   - If your track mounts directly to panel: 34" from panel bottom
2. Draw level horizontal line at this height across panel
3. Use laser level or 4' level - **track MUST be perfectly level**
4. Mark track start and end points (see horizontal position above)

### Step 19: Pre-Drill Track Mounting Holes

**Determine your track's mounting hole pattern:**
Most barn door tracks have mounting holes every 8-12"

1. Position track on marked line (do not install yet)
2. Mark all mounting hole locations on panel
3. Pre-drill 1/8" pilot holes at each mark
4. Drill through panel into cabinet structure behind

**CRITICAL:** Ensure screws will hit solid material (cabinet top or backing) not just the 3/4" panel alone. The barn door weighs 30-50 lbs and exerts significant force on the track.

**Reinforcement Options:**

If concerned about mounting strength:
1. Add 3/4" plywood blocking behind panel at track location
2. Use longer screws (2-1/2" to 3")
3. Add toggle bolts or structural anchors

### Track Installation Note

The actual barn door track installation is covered in **Chapter 7: Barn Door Section**. This chapter prepared:
- The mounting surface (Living Room Panel)
- The X-frame aesthetic that coordinates with barn door
- The pre-drilled mounting holes
- The track position marks

## Quality Checkpoint: Living Room Panel Complete

Before proceeding to barn door installation (Chapter 7), verify:

### Panel Construction
- [ ] Panel dimensions exactly 92" x 34-1/2"
- [ ] Panel is square (diagonals equal)
- [ ] X-frame sections are equal width (~27" each)
- [ ] All X-diagonals cross at center of sections
- [ ] No gaps in mitered frame corners
- [ ] All nail holes filled and sanded
- [ ] Surface is smooth and ready for paint (or painted)

### Panel Installation
- [ ] Panel is plumb (vertical) with level
- [ ] Panel is flush with cabinet top and bottom
- [ ] Panel is flush at both cabinet ends
- [ ] Panel does not flex when pressed
- [ ] All pocket screws are tight
- [ ] No visible fasteners from living room view

### Barn Door Prep
- [ ] Track line marked and perfectly level
- [ ] Mounting holes pre-drilled
- [ ] Holes penetrate solid backing (not just panel)

### Finishing
- [ ] Panel is primed
- [ ] First paint coat applied (if following Option A)
- [ ] Second paint coat applied
- [ ] No drips, runs, or brush marks
- [ ] Crevices and corners fully coated

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Mitered frame corners have gaps

**Cause:** Miter cuts not exactly 45 degrees, or panel edges not perfectly square

**Fix:**
- Fill gap with wood filler
- Sand smooth
- Caulk joint before painting
- Clamp corners while glue dries on future joints

### Problem: Panel doesn't sit flat against cabinet backs

**Cause:** Cabinet backs not aligned, or panel warped

**Fix:**
- Check cabinet alignment first - adjust cabinets if needed
- Use shims behind panel to fill gaps
- Apply construction adhesive to bridge gaps
- Pull panel tight with pocket screws

### Problem: X-diagonals don't meet at center

**Cause:** Section measurements off, or diagonals cut incorrectly

**Fix:**
- Always measure actual section dimensions
- Cut diagonals slightly long, trim to fit
- If already installed, caulk and paint will hide minor gaps

### Problem: Panel flexes when pressed

**Cause:** Not enough screws, or screws not reaching cabinet structure

**Fix:**
- Add more pocket screws
- Use longer screws that reach cabinet backs
- Add construction adhesive for additional rigidity

### Problem: Barn door track sags in center

**Cause:** Track not secured to solid backing

**Fix:**
- Add 3/4" plywood blocking behind panel
- Use longer screws
- Ensure screws penetrate cabinet structure, not just panel

|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Cabinet boxes (exterior) | Paint (navy/charcoal) | Before assembly |
| Cabinet boxes (interior) | Paint or clear coat | Before assembly |

## Phase 2: Cabinet Box Painting (Week 2)

### Pre-Assembly Approach (Recommended)

Paint cabinet box panels BEFORE assembling the boxes. This provides:
- Easier access to all surfaces
- No masking needed
- No tight corners to reach
- Better finish quality

### 2A. Surface Preparation (Day 1)

**All Plywood Panels:**
1. Sand with 150 grit (with grain direction)
2. Progress to 220 grit
3. Fill any voids, holes, or imperfections with wood filler
4. Allow filler to dry (follow product directions)
5. Sand filled areas smooth with 220 grit
6. Vacuum thoroughly
7. Wipe with tack cloth
8. Wipe with denatured alcohol to remove oils

### 2B. Priming (Day 2)

**Primer: Zinsser B-I-N Shellac-Based Primer**

1. Set up in well-ventilated area (shellac primer has odor)
2. Stir primer thoroughly
3. Apply with quality brush to edges and details first
4. Roll flat surfaces with 4" foam roller or 1/4" nap microfiber roller
5. Tip off with brush in direction of grain
6. Allow 45 minutes to 1 hour dry time
7. Light sand with 220 grit (very light - just knock down nibs)
8. Vacuum and tack cloth
9. Apply second coat of primer if needed (especially on edges)
10. Allow to dry 2+ hours before paint

### 2C. First Paint Coat (Day 3)

**Paint: Benjamin Moore Advance (Satin) or Sherwin Williams Emerald Urethane (Satin)**

1. Stir paint thoroughly (do not shake - creates bubbles)
2. Pour paint into clean tray
3. Load brush - don't overload, tap off excess
4. Cut in edges and details with brush
5. Immediately roll flat surfaces with 4" foam roller
6. Keep a wet edge - work systematically
7. Apply thin coat (thick coats sag and show brush marks)
8. Allow to dry according to product:
   - Benjamin Moore Advance: 16 hours minimum
   - Sherwin Williams Emerald Urethane: 4 hours minimum

### 2D. Sand Between Coats (Day 4)

1. Light sand all surfaces with 320 grit
2. Focus on any drips, brush marks, or orange peel
3. Do NOT sand through primer
4. Vacuum thoroughly
5. Tack cloth all surfaces

### 2E. Second Paint Coat (Day 4-5)

1. Apply second coat following same process
2. This should be the final coat for panels
3. Allow 24-48 hours dry time before handling

### 2F. Assembly (Day 6-7)

1. Carefully assemble cabinet boxes
2. Use painter's tape on any surfaces that might scuff
3. Avoid clamping directly on painted surfaces
4. Touch up any scuffs after assembly with small artist brush

## Phase 3: Door and Drawer Front Painting (Week 2-3)

### Doors and drawer fronts can be painted simultaneously with cabinet boxes or after.

### 3A. Preparation

1. If pre-made doors: remove all dust and debris
2. If previously finished: lightly sand with 220 grit
3. For shaker style doors, pay special attention to panel edges
4. Clean with denatured alcohol

### 3B. Priming

1. Set doors on paint pyramids or sawhorses
2. Apply Zinsser B-I-N primer to backs first
3. Allow 45 minutes, flip
4. Apply primer to fronts
5. For shaker doors: brush inner panel edges, then roll flat areas
6. Light sand with 320 grit when dry

### 3C. Painting

1. Apply paint to backs first
2. Allow to dry, flip
3. Apply paint to fronts
4. For shaker doors:
   - Brush inner panel first
   - Brush rail and stile edges
   - Roll flat areas
   - Tip off with brush
5. Allow first coat to dry completely
6. Sand lightly with 320 grit
7. Apply second coat
8. Allow 48-72 hours cure before installing hardware

## Phase 4: Final Assembly and Touch-Up (Week 3)

### 4A. Cabinet Installation

1. Install cabinet boxes (they should already have 2 coats of paint)
2. Handle carefully to avoid scuffs
3. Wear clean cotton gloves

### 4B. Post-Installation Touch-Up

1. Inspect all surfaces for scuffs, scratches, or damage from installation
2. Light sand damaged areas with 320 grit
3. Apply touch-up paint with small artist brush
4. Feather edges to blend
5. Allow to dry
6. If visible, apply one more light coat

### 4C. Hardware Installation

1. Wait 7+ days after final paint before installing hardware
2. Pre-drill all holes
3. Use masking tape under drill to catch debris
4. Install pulls and knobs
5. Adjust hinges as needed

## Phase 5: Butcher Block Finishing (Week 4)

### Why Last?

Finishing the butcher block AFTER cabinet installation:
- Prevents damage during installation
- Allows seam to be joined and sanded first
- Final finish protects against construction debris
- Clean work surface after all other work complete

### 5A. Butcher Block Joining (If Applicable)

1. Join the two 72" slabs per WS3 joining method
2. Allow glue to cure fully (24 hours)
3. Sand seam flush
4. Proceed with finishing

### 5B. Butcher Block Sanding

1. Sand entire surface with 80 grit (only if needed for seam or damage)
2. Progress to 120 grit
3. Progress to 150 grit
4. Vacuum thoroughly
5. Tack cloth

### 5C. Butcher Block Finish Application

**Using Rubio Monocoat Oil Plus 2C:**

1. Apply thin layer with plastic spreader
2. Work in sections
3. Wait 3-5 minutes
4. Wipe off ALL excess
5. Buff with clean cloth
6. Allow 24-36 hours before light use
7. Full cure 5-7 days

## Tips for Professional Results

### General Tips

1. **Temperature matters:** Paint between 50-85F, low humidity
2. **Dust is the enemy:** Clean workspace thoroughly before each finish step
3. **Thin coats:** Multiple thin coats beat one thick coat every time
4. **Don't rush dry times:** Especially with Benjamin Moore Advance
5. **Tack cloth before every coat:** Removes dust particles

### Brush/Roller Tips

1. Use high-quality brushes (Purdy, Wooster)
2. 4" foam rollers or 1/4" nap microfiber for cabinets
3. Remove loose bristles before starting
4. Don't overload brush - tap off excess
5. Maintain wet edge - don't go back into drying paint

### Touch-Up Tips

1. Use an artist brush for small touch-ups
2. Thin paint slightly with Floetrol for better flow
3. Feather edges to blend
4. Multiple light touch-ups better than one heavy one

## Pre-Finish vs Post-Finish Decision Tree

```
Is the component removable?
├── YES (doors, drawer fronts, shelves)
│   └── PRE-FINISH before installation
│       ├── Easier access
│       ├── Better finish quality
│       └── No masking needed
│
└── NO (installed cabinet boxes)
    └── Pre-finish panels, assemble, then touch up
        ├── Paint panels before assembly
        ├── Carefully assemble
        └── Touch up scuffs after
```

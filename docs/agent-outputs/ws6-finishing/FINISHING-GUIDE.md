## 1. Paint Color Selection

### Selected Color: Benjamin Moore Hale Navy (HC-154)

- **LRV:** 6.3 (very dark, rich color)
- **Undertones:** Gray (prevents it from being overwhelming)
- **Why it works:** Classic navy that pairs perfectly with warm wood tones. Benjamin Moore's #1 selling navy for decades. The gray undertones make it sophisticated and safe in any lighting.

### Alternative Option: Sherwin Williams Iron Ore (SW 7069)

*If you prefer a charcoal over navy, Iron Ore is an excellent alternative.*

- **LRV:** 6 (deep charcoal, almost black)
- **Undertones:** Slight blue (dramatic without harshness)
- **Why it works:** Creates striking contrast with warm acacia butcher block. Modern farmhouse favorite. Looks more black in low light, charcoal in bright light.
- **Note:** Can be color-matched at Benjamin Moore store if you prefer Advance paint.

### Paint Product Recommendation

**Benjamin Moore Advance (Waterborne Alkyd) - Satin**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Type | Waterborne alkyd (levels like oil, cleans like latex) |
| Sheen | Satin (recommended) |
| Dry time | 16 hours between coats |
| Full cure | 7-14 days |
| Application | Brush and roller |
| Price | ~$80/gallon |
| Coverage | 400-450 sq ft/gallon |

**Why Advance:**
- Self-levels beautifully (minimal brush marks)
- Acts like oil-based paint (smooth finish)
- Low VOC, water cleanup
- Durable enough for cabinets
- Works great with brush/roller (no spray needed)

### Sheen: Satin vs Semi-Gloss

| Factor | Satin | Semi-Gloss |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Hide imperfections | Better | Shows more |
| Brush mark visibility | Lower | Higher |
| Durability | Very good | Excellent |
| Cleanability | Good | Excellent |
| Modern look | Yes | Can look dated |
| Recommendation | **Primary choice** | Alternative for high-touch areas |

**Verdict:** Satin finish recommended. More forgiving for DIY application and achieves modern aesthetic.

## 2. Cabinet Painting Technique

### Materials Needed

**Prep Materials:**
- 150 grit sandpaper
- 220 grit sandpaper
- 320 grit sandpaper (between coats)
- Tack cloths (4-6)
- Denatured alcohol
- Wood filler (DAP Plastic Wood)
- Painter's tape (Frog Tape)

**Primers & Paint:**
- Zinsser B-I-N Shellac-Based Primer (1 quart)
- Benjamin Moore Advance Satin (2 gallons)

**Application Tools:**
- High-quality 2.5" angled brush (Purdy or Wooster)
- 4" foam mini rollers (6 pack)
- Mini roller frame
- Paint tray
- Paint pyramids or sawhorses
- Drop cloths
- Clean cotton rags

### Surface Preparation

**Step 1: Sand All Surfaces**
1. Sand all plywood panels with 150 grit, following wood grain
2. Progress to 220 grit for smooth finish
3. Don't skip grits - each prepares for the next

**Step 2: Fill Imperfections**
1. Apply wood filler to any voids, holes, or defects
2. Slightly overfill (filler shrinks)
3. Allow to dry completely (follow product directions)
4. Sand flush with 220 grit

**Step 3: Clean Surfaces**
1. Vacuum all dust from surfaces
2. Wipe with tack cloth
3. Wipe with denatured alcohol on clean rag
4. Allow to dry 15 minutes

### Priming

**Why Zinsser B-I-N?**
- Superior adhesion to plywood
- Stain blocking (prevents bleed-through)
- Sands beautifully smooth
- Fast drying (45 minutes)
- Creates ideal base for paint

**Priming Process:**
1. Work in well-ventilated area (shellac primer has odor)
2. Stir primer thoroughly
3. Brush edges and details first
4. Roll flat surfaces with foam roller
5. Tip off with brush in grain direction
6. Allow 45 minutes to dry
7. Light sand with 320 grit (just knock down nibs)
8. Vacuum and tack cloth
9. Apply second coat if needed on edges/end grain

### Paint Application

**The Brush + Roll Technique (Professional Results Without Spray)**

**Step 1: Cut In**
1. Load brush - don't overload, tap off excess
2. Brush all edges, inside corners, and detail areas
3. Work in 3-4 foot sections

**Step 2: Roll Immediately**
1. While brush work is still wet, load foam roller
2. Roll flat surfaces with light, even pressure
3. Overlap into brush work slightly
4. Keep a wet edge - don't let any area dry before connecting

**Step 3: Tip Off**
1. With nearly dry brush, lightly drag across surface
2. Follow wood grain direction
3. This removes roller texture and brush marks
4. Work quickly before paint starts to tack

**Step 4: Allow to Dry**
- Benjamin Moore Advance: 16 hours minimum
- Don't rush! This paint needs time to level

**Step 5: Sand Between Coats**
1. Light sand with 320 grit
2. Remove any dust nibs, brush marks, or orange peel
3. Don't sand through primer
4. Vacuum and tack cloth

**Step 6: Apply Second Coat**
1. Follow same process
2. This is your final coat for most surfaces
3. Allow 24-48 hours before handling

### Tips for Professional Finish

1. **Temperature:** Paint between 50-85F, 40-70% humidity
2. **Thin coats:** Two thin coats beat one thick coat
3. **Don't overwork:** Make your stroke, then leave it alone
4. **Wet edge:** Keep connecting to wet paint
5. **Quality tools:** Cheap brushes leave cheap marks
6. **Prep is 80%:** Time spent sanding = quality of finish
7. **No rushing:** Let each coat fully dry before sanding

## 3. Wood Accent Finishing

### Surfaces to Finish as Wood Accents

| Component | Treatment | Color Goal |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Barn door X-panel | Stain + Clear | Warm, matches butcher block |
| X-frame end panels | Stain + Clear | Warm, matches barn door |
| Internal shelves | Clear only OR stain | Optional - can match cabinet |

### Stain Selection

**Recommended: Minwax Golden Oak (210B)**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Type | Oil-based penetrating stain |
| Color | Warm golden honey tone |
| Compatibility | Works with acacia, pine, poplar |
| Application | Wipe on, wipe off |
| Dry time | 8 hours before clear coat |

**Why Golden Oak:**
- Warm tone complements acacia butcher block
- Classic farmhouse color
- Not too dark - lets wood grain show
- Widely available

**Alternative Option: Minwax Early American (230)**
- Slightly warmer/more amber than Golden Oak
- Good if you want more honey color

### Clear Coat Selection

**Recommended: Minwax Fast-Drying Polyurethane (Satin)**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Type | Oil-based polyurethane |
| Sheen | Satin (or Semi-Gloss for more sheen) |
| Coats needed | 2-3 |
| Dry time | 3-4 hours between coats |
| Full cure | 3-7 days |
| Application | Brush |

### Application Process

**Day 1: Prep and Stain**
1. Sand with 120 grit, then 150 grit, then 220 grit
2. Raise grain: mist with water, let dry 2 hours
3. Sand again with 220 grit (removes raised fibers)
4. Apply Minwax Pre-Stain Wood Conditioner
5. Wait 5-15 minutes (don't let it dry completely)
6. Apply stain with brush or rag
7. Wait 5-10 minutes (longer = darker)
8. Wipe off excess with clean cloth
9. Allow 8+ hours to dry

**Day 2: First Clear Coat**
1. Stir polyurethane (never shake - causes bubbles)
2. Apply thin coat with quality brush
3. Brush with the grain
4. Don't overwork - make stroke and leave it
5. Allow 3-4 hours to dry

**Day 2: Second Clear Coat**
1. Light sand with 320 grit
2. Tack cloth
3. Apply second thin coat
4. Allow 3-4 hours to dry

**Day 3: Third Clear Coat (Optional but Recommended)**
1. Light sand with 320 grit
2. Tack cloth
3. Apply final coat
4. Allow 24 hours before handling
5. Full cure 3-7 days

### Creating Contrast: Painted Cabinet vs Wood Accents

The design achieves contrast through:

1. **Color contrast:** Dark navy/charcoal against warm golden wood
2. **Texture contrast:** Smooth painted surface vs visible wood grain
3. **Sheen contrast:** Satin paint vs satin clear coat (subtle difference)

**Design tip:** Keep wood accents similar in tone to butcher block for cohesion.

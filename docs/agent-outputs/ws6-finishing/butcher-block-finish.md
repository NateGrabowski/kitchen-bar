## Important Notes for Acacia Wood

1. **Acacia is Dense:** It absorbs finishes slower than pine or oak. This is good - less product needed.

2. **Natural Oils:** Acacia has natural oils. Allow new butcher block to acclimate 2-3 days before finishing.

3. **Color Variation:** Chevron pattern means grain direction varies. Apply finish in multiple directions to ensure coverage.

4. **Joining Seam:** If joining two slabs, apply finish after seam is complete and sanded smooth.

5. **End Grain:** Pay extra attention to end grain at edges - may need additional product.

#### Option A: Mount to Toe Kick Face (Recommended)

```
Side View:
                    │ CABINET │
                    │  FACE   │
                    │         │
                    ├─────────┤ ← Cabinet bottom
                    │         │
   [Bracket]────────│  TOE    │ ← Bracket screws into toe kick face
        ║           │  KICK   │   (use backing block for strength)
   [Foot Rail]      │         │
        ║           │         │
════════╬═══════════│─────────│ ← 6" from floor
                    └─────────┘
                       FLOOR
```

**Mounting Steps:**
1. Mark bracket locations at 3", 46", and 89" from left edge
2. Mark 6" height from floor at each location
3. Install backing blocks inside toe kick (2×4 blocking)
4. Drill pilot holes through toe kick face into backing
5. Mount brackets with provided screws
6. Slide tube through brackets
7. Secure set screws on brackets
8. Install end caps

#### Option B: Mount to Cabinet Underside

If toe kick is recessed too far, mount to underside of cabinet bottom.

```
Side View:
                    │ CABINET │
                    │  FACE   │
   [Bracket]────────┼─────────│ ← Bracket screws into cabinet bottom
        ║           │  TOE    │   (angled bracket required)
   [Foot Rail]      │  KICK   │

                    └─────────┘
                       FLOOR
```

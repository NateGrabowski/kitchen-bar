# Countertop Outlet Options - Kitchen Bar

**Purpose:** Research and recommendations for countertop electrical outlets
**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Agent:** WS7 Electrical

## Executive Summary

For the kitchen bar countertop (homework station/laptop charging), a **pop-up outlet with GFCI and USB-C** is recommended. The bar functions as a kitchen island, so 2023 NEC code requires any installed outlets to be GFCI/AFCI protected and located IN the countertop surface (not below the edge).

**Recommended Product:** Lew Electric PUR20-BK-GFI-2USB-AC

---

## Code Requirements (2023 NEC / 2024 IRC)

### GFCI Protection Required
- All kitchen receptacles must have GFCI protection (NEC 210.8(A)(6))
- Kitchen island countertop outlets must have GFCI + AFCI protection
- No exceptions for distance from sink

### Placement Rules
- Kitchen island outlets MUST be installed IN the countertop surface
- Under-edge mounting is no longer permitted (safety hazard with cords)
- Pop-up or flush-mount styles are code-compliant

### Circuit Requirements
- Countertop outlets must be on 20A branch circuit
- Kitchen requires minimum 2 separate 20A circuits for small appliances
- AFCI protection also required in addition to GFCI

## Pop-Up vs Flush-Mount Comparison

| Feature | Pop-Up Outlet | Flush-Mount Outlet |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Visibility** | Hidden when closed | Always visible |
| **Water resistance** | Excellent (closed position) | Moderate |
| **Countertop hole size** | 3.75" diameter typical | 4" x 4" or similar |
| **Ease of use** | Push to open/close | Always accessible |
| **Aesthetic** | Modern, clean | Utilitarian |
| **Cost** | $150-$350 | $30-$80 |
| **Installation difficulty** | Moderate | Easy |
| **Best for** | Kitchen islands, bars | Wall-mounted, backsplash |

**Recommendation:** Pop-up for this project due to:
1. Modern aesthetic (matches farmhouse modern style)
2. Superior water resistance (butcher block top)
3. Hidden when not in use (clean countertop)

## Placement Recommendations

### Location on 92" Counter

```
Kitchen Side (seating side)

                   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                   │                        BUTCHER BLOCK TOP                      │
                   │                           (92" x 30")                         │
                   │                                                               │
  Knee Space  →    │    ●                                                          │

                   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         ↑
                      6" from
                    kitchen edge

                   0"              30"              60"             92"
                   DRAWERS         BARN DOOR       DOUBLE DOOR
```

**Recommended Position:**
- **Horizontal:** 15" from left edge (centered over drawer section)
- **Vertical:** 6" from kitchen-side edge (within knee space zone)
- **Distance from edge:** Minimum 3" from any edge

**Rationale:**
1. Drawer section is primary "desk/homework" area
2. Centered in knee space for laptop use
3. Away from barn door mechanism
4. Clear of cabinet lid access

### Alternative Position

If primary position interferes with drawer slides:
- **Horizontal:** 45" from left edge (centered on barn door section)
- Same 6" from kitchen edge

## Installation Requirements

### Countertop Preparation

1. **Hole Size:** 3.75" diameter for Lew Electric PUR20
2. **Tool Needed:** 3.75" hole saw or Forstner bit
3. **Clearance Below:** Minimum 5.5" (6" recommended)
4. **Edge Distance:** Minimum 3" from any edge

### Wiring Requirements

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Wire Gauge** | 12 AWG (required for 20A circuit) |
| **Cable Type** | 12/2 NM-B (Romex) or 12/2 MC |
| **Circuit Breaker** | 20A AFCI/GFCI combination (or AFCI only if outlet has GFCI) |
| **Junction Box** | Required at power source |
| **Conduit** | Optional but recommended for cabinet interior |

### Connection Method

The Lew Electric PUR20 series has:
- Pre-wired 36" pigtail leads
- Standard screw terminals for Romex connection
- Requires junction box for splicing (inside cabinet)

---

## Power Routing Options

### Option A: Tap Existing Kitchen Circuit (Recommended)

Most cost-effective if there's an existing 20A kitchen circuit nearby.

1. Locate existing 20A kitchen outlet (ideally behind current railing)
2. Turn off breaker, verify dead
3. Add junction box behind cabinet
4. Run 12/2 Romex from junction box to pop-up location
5. Pop-up has built-in GFCI, so upstream GFCI not required

**Note:** Check existing circuit load. Kitchen circuits often already serve multiple appliances.

### Option B: New Dedicated Circuit (Cleanest)

For heavy use or if no accessible circuit exists.

1. Install new 20A AFCI breaker in panel
2. Run 12/2 Romex from panel to cabinet location
3. Install junction box inside cabinet
4. Connect to pop-up outlet

**Estimated Electrician Cost:** $150-$300 for new circuit

### Option C: Surface-Mount from Existing Outlet

If no in-wall access:
1. Use surface-mount raceway from existing outlet
2. Run along baseboard, up through toe kick
3. Less aesthetic but functional

**I want to create a bar in my kitchen.**

- I want to replace the metal rail with a bar that has cabinets from the other side.
- The kitchen sits higher than the other room so this kind of thing doesn't seem super common. It's about 23 1/2 inches from living room floor to kitchen floor.
- **Pillar is removable** — We may remove or may keep it. Really undecided and depends on what we go with.
- The seating will be in the kitchen side so you can look into the living room from the kitchen.

**Bar**

- I'd like to make the bar least 25" deep.
- About 84 inches of bar/counter. (we are thinking butcher block)
- Probably somewhere around 40 inches for height.

**Cabinets**

- **Placement** — Could sit on the living room floor or tuck under the bar... not sure yet

**Goals**

- **Multiple uses** — homework, working from home, eating meals, seating in kitchen while cooking, and just extra place for chit chatting.
- Look nice
- Good seating while providing some storage

# Split-Level Kitchen Bar Design Research

**Date:** January 4, 2026
**Project:** Kitchen Bar Design Exploration
**Context:** 23.5" step between kitchen and living room, 84" bar length, farmhouse modern aesthetic

---

## 1. Structural Approaches

### 1.1 Framing Basics

For a half-wall bar/peninsula, standard construction uses 2x4 lumber framing:

- **Stud spacing:** 16" on center (aligns with drywall, maximizes rigidity)
- **Bottom plate:** Secured with construction adhesive + screws every 16"
- **Blocking:** Add horizontal blocking between studs where brackets/electrical will mount
- **Sheathing:** Plywood under drywall provides shear strength

**For your 60"+ tall cabinet** (bar top to LR floor):
- Frame extends from LR floor to bar top height
- Upper section (above kitchen floor) requires standard 16" O.C. framing
- Lower section (step area) can use same stud grid, extending down

### 1.2 Countertop Overhang Support

**The Rules:**
- Up to 12" overhang: Often needs no support (depends on material)
- 12-15" overhang: Requires brackets/corbels
- 15"+ overhang: Requires heavy-duty steel support mounted to studs

**Your situation (16" overhang):**
- REQUIRES support brackets
- Steel L-brackets or hidden flat brackets recommended
- Spacing: Every 16-24" apart, starting 4-6" from each end

**Bracket Options:**

| Type | Profile | Load Rating | Best For |
|------|---------|-------------|----------|
| Standard L-Bracket | Visible | ~300 lbs/pair | Budget option |
| Hidden Flat Bracket | 2.5" wide, invisible | 325 lbs each | Clean look |
| Decorative Corbels | 6-9" depth | Varies | Farmhouse aesthetic |

**Corbel sizing rule:** Corbels should be at least 1/2 the overhang depth (8"+ for 16" overhang)

### 1.3 Cantilever/Structural Considerations

**The 1/3 Rule:** For cantilevers, extend no more than 1/3 of the back span outside the support point. Your bar's cabinet depth provides the "back span" that anchors the overhang.

**For 84" span:**
- Support brackets every 16-24"
- 4-5 brackets across the span
- Butcher block is lighter than stone, but still needs proper support

## 2. Cabinet Configurations

### 2.1 Key Constraint: LR-Facing Access

User requirement: Cabinets must face living room for easy access (no crawling under bar).

**This means:**
- Cabinet doors/drawers open toward living room
- Access from standing position in LR, not from kitchen side
- Fits the "continuous cabinet" design in current visualization

### 2.2 Configuration Options

| Configuration | Description | Pros | Cons |
|---------------|-------------|------|------|
| **Continuous Cabinet** | Single unit from bar top to LR floor | Max storage, uses step area | Custom build required |
| **Kitchen Floor Cabinets** | Standard cabinets on kitchen floor | Can use pre-made boxes | Less storage, step wasted |
| **Hybrid** | Upper cabinets on kitchen floor + lower storage in step | Mix of options | More complex layout |
| **Open Shelving** | No doors, display-focused | Easy access, visual interest | Less hidden storage |

### 2.3 Farmhouse Modern Cabinet Styles

Key characteristics for farmhouse modern:
- **Shaker-style doors** - Simple, clean lines
- **Fluted panels** - Vertical grooves add texture/depth
- **Two-tone finishes** - White upper/dark lower or vice versa
- **Black metal hardware** - Matte black handles, barn door style
- **Natural wood accents** - Raw wood paired with painted surfaces

**Popular farmhouse finishes:**
- Antique white / Off-white
- Warm gray
- Navy blue (accent)
- Natural wood tones

### 2.4 Step-Integrated Storage

Creative option: Build drawers INTO the step riser itself
- Shallow pull-out drawers (6-8" deep max given step depth)
- Good for: Remote controls, coasters, small items
- Requires custom fabrication

## 3. Bar Top Design

### 3.1 Chevron/Herringbone Butcher Block

**Product availability:**
- **Hardwood Reflections** (Home Depot): 8 ft L x 25" D Hevea Chevron Butcher Block
- **Custom fabricators:** Etsy, local woodworkers
- **Pricing:** $35-100/sq ft depending on wood species and complexity

**Pattern options:**
- Full chevron across entire span (dramatic statement)
- Chevron center with straight-grain borders (framed look, easier to source)
- End-grain butcher block (traditional, durable but heavy)

### 3.2 Light Wood Species for Farmhouse

| Species | Color | Hardness | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------|-------|
| Hevea (Rubberwood) | Light blonde | Medium | Affordable, sustainable |
| Maple | Light cream | Hard | Classic, durable |
| White Oak | Light tan | Hard | Popular farmhouse choice |
| Ash | Light with grain | Hard | Pronounced grain pattern |
| Birch | Light yellow | Medium | Budget-friendly |

### 3.3 Edge Profiles

For farmhouse modern:
- **Square edge** - Clean, modern (most common)
- **Eased edge** - Slightly rounded, safer
- **Bullnose** - Full round, traditional
- **Live edge** - Natural bark edge, rustic statement

### 3.4 Support Requirements for 84" Span

- **Minimum thickness:** 1.5" for butcher block (you have this)
- **Support spacing:** Every 24-36" recommended
- **For overhang:** Steel brackets at 16-24" intervals
- **Allow expansion:** 1/8" gap at walls for wood movement

### 3.5 Finish Options

- **Mineral oil** - Food safe, needs regular reapplication
- **Tung oil** - Natural, water resistant, periodic maintenance
- **Polyurethane** - Most durable, less "natural" look
- **Waterlox** - Blend of tung oil + resin, popular choice

## 4. Creative & Unconventional Ideas

### 4.1 Step/Riser Treatments

The 23.5" step face is a design opportunity:

- **Shiplap or beadboard paneling** - Classic farmhouse
- **Fluted vertical panels** - Modern texture
- **Tile with pattern** - Mediterranean/eclectic
- **LED strip lighting** - Under lip for evening glow
- **Integrated drawers** - Functional storage in the riser
- **Painted accent color** - Contrast with bar body

### 4.2 Lighting Integration

**Under-cabinet LED options:**
- Warm white (2700-3000K) for farmhouse ambiance
- Dimmable strips with hidden channel
- Puck lights for accent

**Pendant placement:**
- 30-36" above bar surface
- Space 24-30" apart for 84" bar (2-3 pendants)
- Farmhouse styles: Mason jar, lantern, industrial cage

**Step lighting:**
- LED strips under step lip
- Creates evening ambiance
- Improves safety

### 4.3 Electrical Integration

- **Pop-up outlets** - Hide in countertop when not in use
- **Outlet strips** - Under bar lip, facing kitchen side
- **USB ports** - Integrated charging
- **Pre-wire before closing framing** - Run conduit during build

### 4.4 Pass-Through Ideas

Options beyond solid half-wall:
- **Open shelf section** - Pass items through
- **Service window** - Hinged or sliding panel
- **Display niche** - Recessed area for decor

### 4.5 Decorative Panel Options for LR Side

- **Board and batten** - Vertical battens over flat panels
- **Wainscoting** - Traditional raised panels
- **Shiplap** - Horizontal planks, farmhouse staple
- **Tongue and groove** - Similar to shiplap, tighter fit
- **Fluted MDF panels** - Modern, paintable

## 5. Applicability to Your 23.5" Step

### What Works Well

| Feature | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Continuous cabinet | 23.5" + cabinet height = substantial LR-accessible storage |
| Step-face paneling | Large surface area for decorative treatment |
| Under-step lighting | Natural location for LED strips |
| LR-facing doors | Easy access without bending/crawling |
| Farmhouse shiplap | Covers step face beautifully |

### Challenges to Consider

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| Cabinet depth limited by step | 12" depth is shallow but workable |
| Custom cabinet heights | Standard 30"/36" don't fit - need 38.5" or custom |
| Step structural integration | May need to verify step construction can support |
| Electrical routing | Plan runs before closing up framing |

## 6. Recommendations Summary

### Structural
1. Frame with 2x4 @ 16" O.C.
2. Use hidden steel flat brackets for 16" overhang (every 18-24")
3. Add blocking where brackets will mount

### Cabinets
1. LR-facing doors confirmed as best approach
2. Consider shaker or fluted panel style for farmhouse modern
3. Explore two-tone finish (light upper, contrast lower OR reverse)

### Bar Top
1. Chevron/herringbone butcher block available from Home Depot or custom
2. Light wood species: Hevea, maple, white oak, or ash
3. Square or eased edge profile
4. 1.5" thickness adequate with proper support

### Creative Elements
1. Step face: Shiplap or fluted panels for farmhouse look
2. Lighting: Under-cabinet LED + step lip lighting
3. Electrical: Pop-up outlets in countertop
4. Consider display niche or pass-through opening

# Kitchen Bar Cabinet Options Research

**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Query:** Cabinet options for split-level kitchen bar after builder bailed - DIY-friendly solutions
**Sources consulted:** 15

## Executive Summary

After a builder bailed, you need DIY-friendly cabinet options for your split-level kitchen bar. The key constraint is an unusual depth (14-16") which most stock cabinets don't offer. Three viable paths emerged:

1. **J Collection Laramie (Home Depot)** - Pre-assembled 14" depth base cabinets, fastest option
2. **IKEA SEKTION** - 15" depth modular system, most flexible and budget-friendly
3. **Custom build** - Full control, most satisfying, requires more time

**Recommendation:** A hybrid approach using IKEA SEKTION cabinets as the base, with custom-built toe kick platform and living room facing panel. This balances cost (~$700-1200), time (2-3 weekends), and quality.

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid

### The Strategy
Use IKEA for what they do well (cabinet boxes), customize everything visible.

### Components

1. **Cabinet boxes:** IKEA SEKTION 15" depth frames
   - 3x 36"W frames = 108" (trim end panels) OR 2x 36" + 1x 18" = 90"
   - Add Shaker-style door fronts (AXSTAD or similar)
   - Include open shelf sections where desired

2. **Custom toe kick/base platform:** Build 8-10" tall base
   - Simple plywood box construction
   - Add architectural detail (recessed panel, furniture legs, or solid with kickplate)
   - This gets IKEA's 30" + your 8-10" base + 1.5"+ countertop = 39.5-41.5" total

3. **Living room facing panel:** Custom built
   - 3/4" plywood with shiplap, beadboard, or Shaker-style panels
   - This is what everyone sees from living room
   - Paint to match cabinet color

4. **Open shelving:** Build custom or use IKEA shelf inserts
   - Mount above closed cabinets OR integrate into design
   - Add LED strip lighting

### Budget Breakdown (Hybrid Approach)
| Item | Estimated Cost |
|------|----------------|
| IKEA SEKTION frames (3x) | $200-400 |
| IKEA doors/fronts | $150-300 |
| Custom toe kick materials | $50-100 |
| Living room facing panel | $75-150 |
| Hardware, trim, misc | $100-200 |
| **Total** | **$575-1150** |

### Timeline
- Weekend 1: IKEA trip, assemble cabinets, build toe kick platform
- Weekend 2: Build/install facing panel, mount cabinets, add trim
- Weekend 3 (optional): Open shelving, LED lighting, finishing touches

## Alternative: Full Custom Build

If maximum pride of ownership matters more than time savings:

1. Build cabinet boxes from 3/4" plywood using Kreg pocket holes
2. Build or buy Shaker doors
3. Build integrated open shelf section
4. Full control over all dimensions and details

**Estimated cost:** $500-1000 materials
**Estimated time:** 2-4 weekends
**Best tutorial:** Woodshop Diaries (basic) or MWA Woodworks (advanced)
